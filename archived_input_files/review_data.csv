Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,not worth the price,"Fingerprint scanner for that price is not worth it. It's a very good keyboard, but the fp scanner should have been standard.",lundi3,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Great keyboard; great cover,"The keyboard feels surprisingly good considering how thin it is. The keys have satisfying tactile response and don't feel rubbery. The build quality is excellent and though the type-cover isn't as rigid as a normal keyboard, it doesn't feel as though it will bend or break. Overall it is an excellent product. My only complaint is that the fingerprint reader doesn't consistently read my finger. I almost always have to scan my finger 3-4 times before it will read. Thankfully the scanning process is very fast -- but still, it leave something to be desired. This may be a software problem, hard to say. That said, I still give the product 4/5 stars.",mevans,4

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Best type cover keyboard on the market,"Coming from mechanical switch keyboards and Thinkpads and typing upwards of 120 wpm I'm really picky about keyboards. Having tried so many type cover keyboards this is clearly the best and even better than a lot of laptop keyboards on the market for tactile and audible feedback, key travel, effective palm rejection, full size keyboard, easy toggling between top row special keys and function keys by pressing Fn key, large glassy smooth touchpad, backlight and bonus fingerprint reader for easy biometric log-in all in a thin light package.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Great keyboard for the surface pro 4,"This is a great feeling and easy to type on keyboard.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Great keyboard,"When I heard that the Surface Pro 4 would have a keyboard that would work with the Surface Pro 3 I was intrigued. When I purchased this keyboard, I was impressed greatly! The keyboard has a better layout, and a better ""feel."" It seems to be a bit more accurate also. The fingerprint id feature is an added bonus.Whether your are a Surface Pro 3 or 4 owner, this keyboard is well worth the price!",ekwo,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,A great redesign!,I purchased a Surface Pro 3 last year. The weakest link of the product was the type cover. The trackpad was too small and the keys were too close together. This new type cover changes the game! The trackpad larger and more responsive. I no longer have to carry a wireless mouse around. The keys are better spaced and the fingerprint reader makes unlocking the system a breeze. This cover is also backwards compatible with Pro 3 & 4. I did take away one star because there is still no where to store the pen. Otherwise I think this is a must upgrade for any surface pro 3 owner. It greatly improves the usability of the product.,Pete,4

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Must have,This keyboard and touchpad our a must have when buying a surface,Dln31095,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Usually works well,"The keyboard is just that, a keyboard. Its got a magnetic connection into the bottom of the Surface Pro 4. However there are times when it just does not function. I'm not sure if this is a keyboard issue or a tablet issue but either way its a major PITA. Sometimes the keyboard will not work as soon as you connect it into the tablet. Sometimes it will just stop working mid typing session. Due to the amount of glitches I have experienced with the Surface Pro 4 I am inclined to believe it is a tablet problem. However, after replacing my Surface Pro 4 with a brand new one I still experience the same glitches with the keyboard. I will say I have not replaced the keyboard at all so I may just have a faulty product.",Sarah,3

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,not necessary,"I purchased this for my Surface Pro 4.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,great upgrade,"feels much better than previous models, love the addition of the fingerprint id.really wish it came in more than just the color black though.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Works great but pricy,Plenty of nice features especially the finger print function for security.,Kooah,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,fingerprint somewhat usless,"extra $30 for fingerprint scanner over the regular keyboard...? hard to say i would miss it if i gotten the regular. the surface pro 4 already has face recognition for loggin into windows, which is extremely convenient. finger print is only useful when i don't want to line my face up with the camera. if print scanner can be use for website logins, then definitely worth it. maybe there's an app for that. I haven't done the research for it. the reader itself is pretty accurate, it usually take the print on the first try.",lundi3,4

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Not worth it,"The fingerprint part works well enough. The trackpad sucks. Coming from the great trackpads on Macs, I just don't understand why a Windows device can't have a nice smooth trackpad like Macs do. The keys are too firm for me compared to the Surface Pro 3 keyboard and my Mac keyboard. I returned this item.",Jeffrey,3

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Why the ID?,"I thought it was a great keyboard, and much better than the pro 3 keyboard.. however, the facial recognition software does the same thing as the fingerprint ID, so why even have it? I took this back and bought a cheaper, open box Surface pro 4 keyboard without the ID. I'm happy I did. It was not worth the extra money.",Casey,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Finally a real keyboard,"Microsoft has the gimmick that says the Surface can replace your laptop. It was 90% there on the Surface Pro 3, the major downside for me being the keyboard. It was a good keyboard, and a great option when it first released. Then after constant use, it worked fine, but never felt like a real keyboard.Finally, the latest keyboard, released with the SP4, and works with the SP3, feels fantastic and functions perfectly! It's much sturdier, mouse pad is larger and more sensitive, keys are spaced apart better and feel better, and finally a fingerprint login option (only on black keyboard as of now). Overall, this keyboard is great! We'll see how I feel when SP5's keyboard comes around. :)",VBSSDV,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Best Tablet Keyboard,"I've used many tablet keyboards but this one is by far the best. Fits perfectly with magnetic connection and does not come loose. The response on the keys is nice even though it is a small tablet keyboard. The fingerprint sensor was easy to setup and is accurate and easy to use. I used to use the iPad Pro with keyboard with keyboard and recently switched to a Surface with keyboard. No comparison, I was able to do so much more with the Surface.",Okram,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Great keypad!,"The keypad itself is excellent. But I need to issue a warning. Since I'm using a corporate login, I can't use the finger print part (or at least have not yet figured out how to use it for my corporate login).",ems37uf,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,The fingerprint ID is worth the extra!,"I did not realize that the Surface uses the camera as a means of identification to log in, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten the keyboard with the fingerprint ID. However, there have been several times where the camera has taken a moment or two to figure out what's going on, or didn't turn on for some reason, so I was able to get logged into the Surface quickly by utilizing the Fingerprint ID. Every time that I've used it, it has worked quickly and easily.",Brack,5

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,A bit unusual to set up - but well worth it!,This was a bit tedious at first to set up but well worth the trouble.During initial setup be sure to touch the fingerprint reader repeatedly as you move your finger around in multiple positions to improve the interface's ability to recognize you.Sometimes will not recognize fingerprint- just be sure touch window is kept very clean.Only Drawback - the COLOR ...ONLY available in Black (I really preferred the dark Blue option available in the new keypad for Surface Pro 4) but having the fingerprint interface adds a bit of a WOW factor !,Barry,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,"Excellent, an improvement on SP3 type cover","I have a Surface Pro 3 and love it. I am an avid user and computer support technician. I have replaced my older Acer I7 laptop with this one, it is quicker and much lighter. I had an older type cover (SP3) which I used and was happy with it except for the touchpad. The newer SP4 touch keyboard with fingerprint is much better: more responsive, feels much more like a normal keyboard and the fingerprint reader gives me near instant access to my desktop. I rate it as Fantastic.",ricklip,5

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,First one broke,"My first keyboard broke in about 2 months. I did extensive testing on it and determined that it was a hardware failure (the trackpad was the only thing not working). Best Buy was great. They returned the keyboard even though I didn't have a warranty. This was a special case though so I wouldn't expect it. Get that warranty, you may need it. The second one works great btw.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Yay Keyboard and trackpad!,"It works!!! Ya, not that special, I personally hate the lack of left and right buttons, but that's the way the industry has gone for some unknown reason (saves them 35 cents?). In my brief use I had quite a few zoom-in gestures occur while attempting to move and click quickly, I'm sure they have a way to disable the pinch zoom gesture on the keyboard...the screen is 2 inches away, zoom there.Also for the fingerprint, haven't used it once...the facial recognition unlock is quicker and easier with probably a greater degree of accuracy now that it has depth sensing.",hacked2123,5

Now that i got my surface i turned on windows hello and use the camera mostly, very convenient. When i was using the device as a tablet without keyboard unlocking the device was a chore. With the camera not so much. So now the fingerprint feature lies mostly unused and i probably could have saved some money by getting the regular type cover? Not worth returning though.The keyboard is nice, pretty easy to type on. A little flexy when not flat down as i type this review. I am not a great typer, kind of a hunt and peck typer so the fact that it isn't full sized doesn't bother me too much. I just wish somebody would make a magnetic cover that doesn't have a keyboard when i want protection but want to travel light...the screen protectors mostly seem to affect the touchscreen sensitivity based on reviews i read.In summation great keyboard, but depending on your security needs the regular type cover might be good enough. Not sure how easy it is to spoof either the fingerprint scanner or the camera. Read an article about researchers using a normal injet printer to spoof fingerprint readers? It is a technology race in the security sector...",schnell,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Awesome keyboard,"To buy a type cover if you own a surface pro is a no brainer - you should, period.The keyboard is really responsive, comfort to type on, and very thin. Plus the design that works like a cover to the surface pro is really good.The question then is if one should by this model - with Fingerprint ID. I personally did, and do not regret it.The Fingerprint ID works really well, and is really responsive. Logging in windows with it is super easy and fast. the downside is that I did not find apps that i normally use that take advantage of the fingerprint id - granted that I did not actively search for them, rather than just checked if the ones I use would benefit. It yet to be seen, though, if the more computers and tablets have this reader, the more developers will add this function. I would love to use it for loggin in my internet accounts for example.Anyway, this purchase is worth the price, but keep in mind that you might be paying extra for a future benefit more than anything.",Bruak,4

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,ID works well,"So I got a new surface 4 and it'd be crazy not to have a keyboard. The keys are springy, but they are a bit click-y so don't think you're going to type like a ninja. I was bummed it only came in black with the fingerprint ID but it works well so it was worth the trade off.",Justn8,4

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Not absolutely necessary,"The SP4 keyboard is largely improved and the clickiness of the keys is definitely something I appreciate. Overall, a great typing experience- keys are well lit and spaced for comfortable typing. While the fingerprint reader does add an extra layer of security and ""future-proofness"", it doesn't otherwise add large improvements. Windows 10 has facial login that you'll likely use more often than this. But having the finger print reader can be handy. If the extra few bucks doesn't matter to you, why not?",wNg11,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Best Keyboard for the Surface Pro,"The fingerprint scanner works flawlessly for me for logging in. I like the response of the keys and the glass trackpad is better than most. I'd prefer a larger trackpad, I have large hands but it's a compact profile and works great otherwise.

This new keyboard from Microsoft is superior in many ways to the original Surface and Surface Pro keyboards. The actual buttons are slightly larger and spread a litter further apart. This allows for a premium typing experience. I find that it rates better than even some laptops I have worked with. The addition of a fingerprint reader is a great new feature.

Very good quality. Keys feel good to the touch. Touchpad is great. Your Surface basically becomes a laptop when the keyboard is attached. This one has the fingerprint reader which works seamlessly with Windows Hello to log you in.

I specifically got the fingerprint scanner, however the facial recognition on my surface makes it less important. I did still set it up, I have not used it once. though it may be nice for when using my computer in a dark room. My only frustration is that I cannot adjust the tilt of the screen without using the kick stand. You never realize you may want to do that until you don't have it lol.

I am extremely happy with it. I can type as quickly on this cover as I could on my laptop's keyboard. The only question people should ask is whether the fingerprint sensor is worth the additional cost. I would say that it is. It is very accurate and fast, and I love the ability to connect it to the LastPass extension. With it, you can literally fill in complicated forms and passwords in ""at the touch of your finger.""

Typically, the quick fix is to wipe reader with my shirt or sleeve...probably better with a wipe...All in all, it works most of the time and is a quicker way to ""sign-on"" than entering my 20 character password!The keyboard easily comes off and on with the tablet and it is magnetized allowing for the keyboard to be at an angle compatible with typing while I was in-flight.",CEUS,4

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Provides a nice typing experience,"The Type Cover provides a nice typing experience for the SP4. It is able to mimic the same experience provided by a notebook but it isn't quite there. Well, it's better than the keyboards built into cheap notebooks but not quite but there with the higher end notebooks. I do like that you can type at an angle or flat, I prefer typing at an angle. The keys feel nice and provide a firm, tactile feedback when clicking them in. They are also backlight and that turns on automatically when in a dim room. The Type Cover is a little flexible and you will notice some bounce when typing but it isn't bad, definitely better than a keyboard in a $400 Dell notebook.The trackpad could use some work. Microsoft made it bigger in the 4th iteration of the Type Cover along with covering it in glass but it still feels somewhat cramped. The trackpad is also noisy, really noisy. I don't use it when I'm in a meeting and instead touch the screen or use the Pen. But the Type Cover is protective, it can turn around completely, and it can be easily attached or removed via the magnetic connector on the bottom of the Surface. It works and is definitely the best solution on the market for the Surface Pro, just don't expect it to perform the same as the keyboard in the Dell XPS13 or HP Spectre x360.The fingerprint scanner is accurate and works like a charm. I just have to wrest my finger on the sensor and that's it. No swiping or any of that nonsense, it just works. I haven't had any problems with it rejecting my finger because it couldn't read it.Most people will be fine with the regular Type Cover and don't need the fingerprint scanner. Windows Hello, which uses your face to log in, works on every Surface Pro 4. Most people aren't going to benefit by also scanning their fingerprint as Windows Hello is accurate, fast, and secure. I have used my fingerprint scanner three times in the two months I've owned my Surface Pro 4 and that was only because I wasn't looking at my Surface when logging in.Save yourself the money and get the regular Type Cover. However, people with a Surface Pro 3 should definitely upgrade to this. Logging in with your fingerprint is faster, easier, and more secure than typing in your Windows PIN number every time and the new keyboard layout and trackpad are a definitely improvement over the Type Cover 3. Upgrading to this Type Cover will extend the life of your Surface Pro 3 making it easier to wait for the Surface Pro 5, maybe even the Pro 6.",Pablo,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,It's been great!,"We bought three of these for use with our surface pro 4 tablets. Outstanding quality and ruggedness.

We have owned and used them for quite a while now and they are working as good as new. We plan to buy more.",GoatLeader,5

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Great addition,I originally considered just using my bluetooth keyboard instead of paying $160 for this because i thought it would be awful to use. But after purchasing this i was very surprised by how much i like typing on this keyboard. The key travel isn't very deep since it is so thin but i really enjoy the tactile feel and sound of it. The fingerprint scanner was the main reason i chose this version over the normal version and it works well most of the time (sometimes need to to be cleaned before it is able to read). I only have two gripes. One is that the model with the fingerprint scanner is only available in black and i really wanted the gray alcantara model. The second is the keys and scanner shows oils from your fingers a lot more that keyboards that i have owned in the past and gets tranferred onto the screen when closed.,AluminumWarrior57,4

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,It hurts my skin.,"I bought the other version of the keyboard and had to return it because it caused me contact dermatitis. I was hopeful that this luxury material would be comfortable, and it's not. Sure, at first it feels soft, but eventually, after spending a few minutes typing, and thus, moving my hands over it too , they start to burn a little, because of the keyboard's rough surface. I'm very dissapointed about the materials they choose. Sure, they are marketed as luxurious, but they're not gentle for the skin. I absolutly love my surface pro 4, but I guess I will have to return it, because I can't seem to find keyboard that won't actually make me feel in pain.",AngelicaH,1
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,"Awesome keyboard, but.","So it's been a little over a year since I purchased this keyboard for my Surface Pro 3. I purchased this type cover over the regular one so that I can take advantage of all that Windows hello has to offer. The island style key spacing was a massive improvement over the Pro 3 cover and the trackpad has a nice texture. The trackpad this time around is a lot more useable for two finger scrolling and pinch to zoom. All the buttons are where you want them to be and the svelte makes it feel premium. The type cover does has its annoyances however. Firstly, the fingerprint scanner doesn't always work when used to unlock the device. often times I would have to disconnect the type cover and reconnect it for it to work. I don't know if this is a software problem regarding the Surface itself or if it's a problem with Windows 10. Maybe a system update for either the Surface Pro 3 or type cover could fix this. the other issue is that when the type cover is folded back the device takes longer to wake up. Interesting because my older Pro 3 cover didn't have this problem. So maybe a software update for the Surface Pro 3 is necessary to address this issue. other than those problems its a solid keyboard.",Andre94,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,For the price it is not all good.,"I bought this keyboard a few months ago but now it is not working even more. It has a nice layout and features but many times I have to reconnect the keyboard for my surface to recognize the finger scanner and keys especially after it goes to sleep. In addition, I take extremely good care of my things but now when I press certain keys there are multiple key strokes for example. I press the letter c and I get xc, I press 1 and I get 12 and vice versa. Throughout this post I have to be correcting my mistake which I don't have time for. I do not have large fingers and it is only this week it has started to give me the key problem. And for the price I paid especially living outside the US It should be immaculate. I have tried to clean around the keys to the best of my ability. there does not seem to be anything stuck between the x and c, and, 1 and 2 keys since they press with ease.",samoku,3
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Excellent Quality and Beautiful Material,"If you have a type cover for your surface pro 4 don't expect this one to do anything different. The only thing different about this cover is the Aesthetics and the material it is made out of. That is also why it is a bit more in price over the original type cover for the SP4. The grey is beautiful match to the color of the SP4 and when working in a professional environment like myself, it gives your surface a more elegant look and touch of class! I purchased a turquoise type cover back when the SP4 launched last October and I was fully aware that I was not getting anything additional by purchasing this one. For the people who gave the device a poor review, doesn't address the actual product itself. The product does it's job, it does it well. If you have the type cover for the SP4 already then you most likely do not need to upgrade to this one as I didn't need to. I WANTED to because of the material and the look of the two pieces combined.",idelgado782,5

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Not worth the extra money,"I received an email from the woman at the front desk: You have a package up here. I dropped what I was doing, ran to the front, grabbed the box, and gt back to my desk as quickly as possible. Channeling my inner Ralphie Parker, I tore open the box, ripped off the plastic and grabbed a hold of the keyboard. Its a crummy commercial: Much like Raphie Parker being told to drink Ovaltine, I questioned why I bought this keyboard. There is nothing special about this keyboard. Sure, it says its made with Alcantara.. and it feels pretty neat - on the outside of the cover (aka the piece that you touch when you carry it). The keyboard itself functions exactly the same, and the inside of the case is the same fabric you would normally have. It has the same chiclet backlit keys, and the same Surface 4 touchpad. It's 30 dollars more to get this slightly silky feeling on the back of the cover. I LOVE the surface tablet, and the keyboards they make for the device are excellent. If you got this keyboard you'd be happy with it, but there's nothing about it that says it's worth the extra money.",ewitkowski,3
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Fingerprint ID does not work well,"I picked this type cover over the signature type cover due to the fingerprint support. I love the keyboard, but the fingerprint reader is useless. I have only been able to successfully unlock with it one time and even then it took multiple tries.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,90 Improvement over the SP3 type cover,"All the features of the SP3 type cover that I had issues with are either dramatically improved or solved with this. The keys are great, and the extra spacing does cut down on errors. The trackpad is much improved It's incredibly responsive and feels great. The addition of a print screen button is key as well, not sure how they missed that the first time around. The only thing I wish it had/did better is to have a little more rigidity. The rigidity, and thus lapability, is the same as the SP3 type cover (so not 100 improved). The new feature of the finger print scanner is nice, and it works incredibly well when it recognizes my finger. I was able to set it up without any issues on my SP3. I am, however, disappointed in how often it fails to recognize my fingerprint though. I've ended up getting in with my picture password several times (about 50 of the time).",segosity,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Possibly overkill,"Given the facial recognition of the Surface, a fingerprint reader is only a secondary entry security option.",Satisfied,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Bad Durability,"I absolutely love this keyboard, and I don't think it deserves a two star rating, but the durability is horrendous. This is a purely aesthetic keyboard, and there are now multiple tears on the edges of the fabric which completely ruins it (and triggers my OCD :3), and the trackpad has two noticeable scratches. My backpack has a pouch meant for laptops, so I am not just throwing it in a bag with pencils poking at it. I am hesitant to recommend this product unless you look to treat your SP4 with the utmost care.",Username,2
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,fingerprint ID is wonderful,After a week of having to type my Microsoft password in every time my screen turned off I was ready to scream. The ease of the fingerprint ID on this Type Cover is a life saver! The Keyboard itself has a good feel. The keys have good tension so it's comfortable to type on whether it's on your lap or on your desk. I would like it better if it had a pen loop-my surface pen doesn't seem to stick as securely with the Type Cover attached. It would actually garner a rating of excellent if there was some way to keep the cover closed while traveling.,pixiepaint,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,"For SP3, mostly a vast improvement","Bought this a month ago for my Surface Pro 3. Like others have said, it is very good overall but there are a few differences from my original SP3 type cover that I dislike. I'm at a loss to explain why they brought back the always-a-mistake Ins(ert) key, and why they moved the HomeEndPage block to place the Ins key over F12 where you are much more likely to mistakenly press it. The Mute and Play/Pause key were switched this is a minor annoyance but still an inconsistency. I presume they moved Mute to be next to the new Volume Up and Down keys that replaced Search and Share. Why did they need VolUp and Dn keys There is already a physical hardware button for that. I almost never used the old middle block of media keys but, besides the new PrtScn key, I wish I had the old keys back and in their old places.",incarnax,4

It looks amazing with my SP4 and works well too. It is backlit, which is my preference for keyboards, and is also fairly sturdy considering how thin and light it is.

The surface does not co-operate well with generic wireless keyboards, so I was forced to purchase this one.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,A HUGE Improvement,"I have a Surface Pro 3 and have loved using it, but the type cover always felt a little less than functional to me. It worked, but I always preferred typing on a full laptop or computer printer if it were anything more than a quick paragraph. Don't even get me started on the tracpad! It was too small and nowhere near sensitive enough. No more! This keyboard feels as good as one on a quality laptop would and it's a joy to type on it. The tracpad isn't even in the same class as the old one. It feels great, it responsive, and is large enough to use comfortably and without moving my hands from the keyboard. I don't see much need to upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 to the 4, but I definitely recommend upgrading the keyboard and pen! The fingerprint scanner is a nice touch and it works great. I've never had to rescan my finger to log in (coming from someone who cannot get phone fingerprint scanners to work ever). However, it's not really necessary. I was hoping that I could use it with a password manager so I could log in to websites with a fingerprint, but I haven't been able to figure that out yet. Whether to get the cover with the scanner or not is a personal choice. Regardless, I recommend either of the updated type covers!",cch1,5

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,This is about aesthetics....,"I own a Surface Pro 4. I bought a black keyboard with the computer. I am very pleased with the keyboard. It is solid and functional. But, this grey two-tone Signature keyboard---which functions exactly the same as the one I have---has a nice tactile feel and the color complements the Surface 4/3. The Signature gives the Surface Pro 3/4 the beautiful all grey look of a Surface Book (or, ahem, a Mac). We're talking personal taste here, for sure. But, if design and style would add pleasure to using your Surface Pro 3/4, you have to take a close look at the Signature. (The other Surface keyboard colors are cool, too.)",PLW2,5

Things that I like: - This keyboard is more quiet than my Surface Pro 3 keyboard - The keys are spacious - The trackpad is larger - The look Things that I did not like: - It costs a little more than the others (though it is the same) - Just like the other Surface Pro 4 Keyboards it does not have the specialized Surface shortcut keys in the top row. It is just a standard keyboard.,Cristen,4
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Stylish and an amazingly good keyboard,"The Surface Pro 4 Type Cover is an amazing product. Astonishingly thin and light, it is still a comfort to type on even for extended periods. It was fun to consider various color options, but none of the options spoke to me like the Alcantara covered Signature edition. This cover has a rich feel and a color that compliments the body of the Surface Pro very well. Matched with the included Surface Pen, this looks like a set of products designed together. As a keyboard, any color Type Cover 4 represents clever and useful technology. Wrapped in Alcantara, the cover is all that and more.",rlon47,5

The trackpad is definitively better but responds weird in certain software, mostly win32 apps with a lot of scrolling history, performance is wonky.

And I use my Surface every day, so I type a lot, and I will be open. For the price it should've of been way better. It is not worth the price.

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Great keyboard!,"Bought this for my SP4 specifically for the fingerprint ID. The fingerprint ID works perfectly for turning on my SP4, though it has not worked as well with the True Key password manager so I reverted back to password for True Key. The typing experience on this keyboard is AMAZING. My PC keyboard now feels mushy by comparison. Wish this keyboard came in colors other than Onyx (black).",leeann808,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,poor quality,"I purchased this keyboard to go with my fantastic Surface Pro4, the high end one. For the money this keyboard is poor quality, so rather than go for this keyboard, my advice is go for the one with the finger print reader, same price, better quality and functions. alas I still have mine, however I purchased the fingerprint one now but have this gray one doing nothing.",weeping,1
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,An unexpected improvement.,"I bought this keyboard solely because I liked how it felt in the store when I typed compared to the type cover I purchased with my Surface Pro 3 over a year ago. I'd spent time typing on this one in the store and thought I knew what to expect. Boy was I wrong! First, yes - the keyboard is exponentially more comfortable and feels somehow faster than the older type cover. Second, WOW the trackpad. This is, by far, the smoothest and most perfectly tuned trackpad I have ever used. The default sensitivity for both movement and tap-to-click is perfect. Third, the fingerprint ID is more useful than I'd expected. In addition to the Windows 10 functionality I already knew about, it also works as a login feature for my password manager and, I'm sure, much more that I haven't discovered yet. Finally, let's talk about (cringe) lapability. The keyboard's magnetic attachment to the screen feels stronger and the whole keyboard feels more rigid and solid than my older type cover. The end result is a device configuration that very closely mimics the stable feeling of a decent laptop. Overall, this keyboard made my Surface Pro 3 new again. In short, this upgrade for my Surface Pro 3 works perfectly and offers improvements I wasn't expecting. I'll be honest and say that I almost never use my old touch cover anymore - I just didn't like it. This, however, I will use. It's one of those things I didn't realize I needed until I got it. If you're a Surface Pro 3 owner and you're looking for a way to refresh that system and make it feel new again - this works well.",AlphaSixRomeo,5

The one feature I was looking forward to using in Windows 10 is Hello! for signing in. This keyboard is the perfect answer.

It also works really well! This was a great tweak on a great product!",rkuefner13,5

Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,Great Keyboard,"I've been using the type cover for a few weeks, and it is about as good as you can get without having a normal keyboard on a laptop.Specifically, the fingerprint scanner is worth the extra money. It makes logging in a breeze and increases your computers security. It works about 90 of the time. I've noticed it is affected by fingerprint grease, so usually that is the culprit. So while it does not work as well as the fingerprint scanner on an iPad 2, or my Galaxy S6, it is still nice.I don't have experience with the previous type covers, but it sounds like they were not very good. I think the track pad size is probably good here, so if Microsoft works on the fingerprint scanner's reliability and also comes out with a few more colors it'll be a 5 star product. I would also make the fingerprint scanner the standard keyboard with the SP5. This product cost about 150 to buy and probably only cost 30 to manufacture, so I think Microsoft can afford it.",A.R.,5
Microsoft,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,A LOT better than the surface pro 3 keyboard One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,A LOT better than the surface pro 3 keyboard. Keys are more spaced out and the trackpad feels much better yet still same size touch cover. Replaced surface pro 3 touch cover as I lost a few keys on it from wear and tear. This one was a phenomenal replacement and came with a fingerprint reader which works great. No longer mistyping keys. Wish it came in different colors as well. Only downside I've seen is that on my surface pro 3 sometimes it takes a little longer to recognize the keyboard and other times the light up keys don't show at all. Seems more of a software update would fix this though. Highly recommend as an upgrade.,Probar,5

It works like the caps lock key does, and it stays on even after shutting the computer off. This, believe it or not, is the number one reason why I bought this keyboard.The backlighting of the keyboard still has (about) the same number of dimness settings however, the transition between each is much more smooth and adds a very nice touch to the keyboard. I'm not going to say that the keys are evenly lit- the spacebar is not lit as much as the others- but it still feels very refined and works well. The backlighting is on the edge of the keys, as well as the individual letters.

Although the sound is pretty good for the price there is a MAJOR flaw that I simply cannot live with. One reviewer talked about this and I should have taken his review more seriously. Simply put, this speaker system does not remember what volume setting OR treble and bass settings you put it in EVERY TIME YOU SWITCH SOURCES. That means if you switch from Bluetooth to the input for example, the volume goes up to a default high volume and all the treble and bass settings have to be programmed AGAIN! You have to be kidding me! Add to that when I try to change one thing on the remote it does another. Clearly cheap infrared processor can't distinguish one infrared code from another at times.Unless you don't plan on using this with multiple sources then stay away.

Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"I buy audio systems by spec and I had never heard of Boytone. I'm an old school audiophile and I have a set of Klipsch V4.2 PC speakers. I was looking for something decent for another application. For the money these speakers are VERY decent. The 6.5 ported subwoofer is a good design and overall sound quality is excellent for the price. The visual design is also very nice. One selling feature for me was that they are compatible with practically all current media, FM, USB, bluetooth, RCA, SD. I compared the Boytone system to the big boys (Creative, Logitech, etc.) and nothing came close. Now for the small number of cons. When you switch sources the volume goes to 18 which is rather loud. Also the display is a bit cryptic. The system does not always respond to the remote on the first button press. But other than these relatively minor issues I have no complaints.

Boytone,Boytone - 2500W 2.1-Ch.

Other than that, everything works perfect. If I could have someone tell me if that's meant to happen I would be happy though. Thank You!",Jacamawama,4

Boytone,Boytone - 2500W 2.1-Ch. Home Theater System - Black Diamond,No good,"This is not at all what it was made out to be. Not at all worth the money. My little Bluetooth portable speaker sounds way better than this thing! The functions are horrible to switch back and forth, when you flip the power switch to “off” it makes a horrible “pop” sound and sounds like the speakers are going to blow. I would not waste a penny on this unit... save your money and donate it to a good cause or something!",Bobby,1
Boytone,Boytone - 2500W 2.1-Ch. Home Theater System - Black Diamond,Boy Oh Boytone,"There aren't many computer speaker systems on the market, as far as I know, where blue tooth technology, an FM radio, USB/Micro SD slots and RCA audio input jacks are incorporated right into the sub-woofer allowing you to play music almost anywhere without any other additional equipment or necessary hook ups. With this being said, these were features that attracted me to purchase the BT-210F model.I have never heard of Boytone before. It seems like a relatively new brand and there are not many reviews out there regarding the products that they are currently selling. My purchase was made with some trepidation.Overall, the unit is really nice looking. The pictures shown for the product give the impression that this set up is much bigger than it really is. The only thing that is big would be the sound. This unit can get pretty loud, especially with the sub-woofer.I would have given this review five stars if not, for what some people will find, quite annoying. Surprisingly, no one else who has already purchased this model has even mentioned what I am about to describe.......Each SOURCE volume for AUX, DVD, USB/SD, FM, BL (Bluetooth) has a preset volume. When you first turn the unit on and scroll to AUX, the volume is preset at AU18. When you scroll to DVD, the preset volume is DU18 and so on.Now I am not sure why Boytone decided to design the unit to perform like this but it is somewhat of an inconvenience.Example scenario. If you are on AUX first, the master volume defaults at AU18. That is a pretty high setting for starts, especially if you do not first adjust the volume of the computer or other device you are using the speakers for prior to powering up the sub-woofer.Read more",Sconi,

Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"I should have known by the price this was too good to be true. Although the sound is pretty good for the price there is a MAJOR flaw that I simply cannot live with. One reviewer talked about this and I should have taken his review more seriously. Simply put, this speaker system does not remember what volume setting OR treble and bass settings you put it in EVERY TIME YOU SWITCH SOURCES. That means if you switch from Bluetooth to the input for example, the volume goes up to a default high volume and all the treble and bass settings have to be programmed AGAIN! You have to be kidding me! Add to that when I try to change one thing on the remote it does another. Clearly cheap infrared processor can't distinguish one infrared code from another at times.Unless you don't plan on using this with multiple sources then stay away. Sorry but this is one heck of a problem which clearly shows this company does not put enough resources in development and user experience.Back in the box to UPS!",neinnunb,2

Day and night difference, we can use all of the streaming services and actually hear them, even if there is a fan or two nearby running, it was easy to hook up and we've tried all the inputs available and they all have worked beautifully, so, we are very happy with it!",PilotShopper,5

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,BOUGHT 3!!,"Before buying, I went to the sanus website and researched this model and made sure it would fit my TV(s).Started off with buying one of these and with our smaller rooms we didn't need a huge amount of extention or tilt and wanted to keep them slim for profile we liked the first one so much, we bought 2 more. This offered us just what we needed - they are very flush with the wall and pull out about 10 inches and can tilt from side to side and down so we bought more becuase the price was one of the best for what it offered. You can spend hundreds of dollars on these so I feel it was a good bargain.Installation was a bit tricky for us because of finding studs and also thinking about the height of where you want it placed versus where your tv will be attached. However, we found out how to measure so it made sense for us and it was right where we wanted it. We also learned that is was easier to leave the tv stand/base on the tv and remove it AFTER you have placed it on the wall mounted holder for the first one we had taken the base off and were trying to hold it....you can imagine holding a big tv and trying to remove the base, so waiting until the wall mount was done and we could rest the tv on it, it was much easier.Once you do one, you can do the others much faster. This worked with our 59'' samsung plasma, 42'' panasonic plasma, and 47'' samsung lcd. Very versatile and many different parts to make it work with your tv - extentions, longer or shorter screws, etc. I would recommend this tv wall mount.",Heather,5

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,Needs modifications to properly fit Sony XBR75x850c,"Beware that this mount will NOT fit the Sony XBR75x850c without some customization that you will have to learn on the fly. It is not in the instructions or on the Sanus website. I probably wouldn't have bought this mount for this TV if I knew of the problem ahead of time. I only came to the realizations discussed below after spending several hours trouble shooting the situation, by which time I had nicked the mount up a bit and felt I couldn't return it.The problem is that the two bracket bars that you mount on the TV sit flush so you assume you do not need to use any of the provided spacers. However, once you mount the TV onto the wall unit and try and put the click cap on the lower cross bar (part number 22), you'll see that this lower cross bar goes so far that it hits raised edges on either side of the back panel of the TV. This is slight, but prevents the lower bar from fully seating into the receivers of the vertical brackets. This prevents the click cap from fitting properly and you won't be able to screw it together. The click cap is a critical component because it holds the bottom of the TV into place on the mount, which is very important when you are tilting the TV.There are two possible solutions. One is to install a spacer between the bracket bar and TV when you start off. Two problems here, one is that it will now be 1/2 less flush, and the other is that there does not seem to be a medium length screw provided that will fit the small spacer yet not penetrate too far into the TV. There is a short screw, fine for when not using any spacer, and a long screw that looks too long to use with the small spacer with this Sony TV (which appears to have a shallow screw receiver. Sorry that I can't tell you if it is since I went directly to solution number two: cut a few inches off the end of each side of the lower horizontal bar to prevent it from running over into the raised area of the back of the TV. This appears fine to me because this lower bar just appears to provide stability. The top bar and wall unit hold the weight. Basically you are cutting the lower horizontal bar short of where the back of the TV sticks out again. Not elegant, I suppose, but it works and keeps it more flush to the wall. You'll see what I mean if you have to go through this exercise.I'm fine with other aspects of the mount. We mounted dead center on the wall so didn't have to worry about the tilt issues that other people mention, but I could see where that could be a problem since the mount has some play. You'd probably have to pay a lot more for a stiffer mount (!).The people at Sanus were very helpful dealing with other questions I had. And I have been happy with two other mounts I bought form them for other TVs. I tried to explain all the above to them but was unsuccessful because its hard to do unless you are looking at it together.",dwen,3

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,"Solid, well-made product with good instructions and customer support","Purchased this product to mount my new Panasonic 65 plasma TV - model TCP65GT50. Wanted a fully articulating mount so I could move it easily to adjust viewing angle as well as access connections on back of the TV, and also wanted a slim profile so it would sit as close to the wall as possible when fully retracted. This mount does all of these things well. I was originally looking at the VLF311 which appeared very similar to the VLF410 except the VLF311 only accomodates TVs up to 65 and costs less, so I emailed Sanus asking about the difference and one of the reps immediately replied and asked that I call him so he could explain. He told me that the VLF410 is the 'second generation' of the VLF311 and offers improved balancing of large TVs. This made sense because I did recall seeing a few customer reviews of the VLF311 saying that their TVs wouldn't hang perfectly level. Of course, this begs the question of why they are still selling the VLF311 when they have admitted it needed to be updated. Anyway, I needed to mount my TV centered between two windows, but the two 16 studs I had to use were exactly four inches off center of where the mount neeeded to be hung. Since the VLF411 has multiple pre-drilled slots which are designed to accomodate studs between 14 and 22 apart, I was able to use two unmatching slots to compensate for three of those four inches but this still left me with the mount being one inch off-center between my two windows. To get that last inch, I hung the TV on the mount and then simply slid the TV one inch to the left so it was hanging one inch off-center of the mount, but perfectly centered between my two windows. Problem solved No, the 86 lb. TV would ever-so-slightly tilt to the left since it was hanging off-center. So much for 2nd generation improvement of the mount! It still has very little tolerance for TVs not hanging perfectly centered. Undeterred, and deciding that the TV was hanging about 6 lower than where I really wanted it, I started over and installed the mount 6 higher and INTENTIONALLY a bit off-level to the right, so when I reinstalled the TV one inch to the left of center on the mount, it hung perfectly. Bottom line -- the multiple pre-drilled mounting slots give you some flexibility to accomodate 'off-center' studs, but if you need more than 3 or 4 inches of wiggle room then be prepared to take more creative action.",petewit,5

I would not tract any of this amounts to do anything but just hang the TV.I bit the bullet and ordered the Sanus. 1st impression is WOW!!! This bracket weighs 25lbs. Yes, 25LBS. Almost as much as some TV'S. The cheaper mounts barely register on the scale. You immediately notice the heft and quality of this piece. It moves fluidly and it is all finished nicely. Everything is well though out and all edges are finished. Bolts all have covers and it has ZERO cheap feel to it.I was in the camp of why pay more but with TV's climbing in prices again there is no way after side by side comparison you would buy the cheaper one. Order both and when you pick up the Sanus box without even opening it you will be blown away. I will update when used for a while but unless things go bad fast I can't see tho snot being a huge jump in quality.

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,This is not the mount you're looking for.,"This so called slim mount does not allow shifting left/right unless fully extended....defeating the purpose of a slim mount in most installations. If you slide the TV on the mounting bar, the bar will tilt or bend and the TV will be tilted toward the heavier side of the bar. This contradicts the information advertised on their webpage, although they have clarified the description somewhat here on amazon. The only way to shift it is to fully extend it from the wall, then the wall arms themselves can shift a few inches on the wall plate. If you are able to install the mount centered between two studs, then perhaps you have no need to shift the TV while in the slim position. My studs were only 3 off center of my wall, yet my TV is lopsided when I move it a few inches to the center. From everything Sanus described about this mount at the time, I understood the TV could be shifted while in any position. Not even close! I need the TV to be close to the wall due to some near side seating. Because of this mount's limitations, we can't view the TV from those sides (the Mount os too far from the wall) and have the TV centered at the same time. I could have purchased a much less expensive slim mount that would have had less limitations than this one. This mount did not fit the bill.",Chartchecker,1

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,"Almost perfect, but watch the specs","I installed this for use with a Sony KDL40HX800, a model about 3 years old and weighing less than 40 pounds. This mount is what is found when using the Sanus website Mountfinder for this model. Most of the one star detraction is my fault, but I'll let Sanus share the star because this mount doesn't really have the rotation that I needed. I didn't specifically look at the rotation spec, my fault, but it's only 30 degrees. Even using a TV that's at the very low end of the size spec, this is a pretty low value, and it would be nice to find different models of mounts that feature different specs for different needs. This one is touted to be super slim, and indeed it is, which I needed due to placement in a walkway to a door. Going for this feature sacrificed rotation evidently. The feature of moving laterally is nice, but of dubious value except in very specific circumstances.The other specs of 10 degree tilt, seems to be about actual performance, but the extension from wall value is spec'ed at 10, but was actually 14. The tilt mechanism was the only poor performer. Even with the tension completely released, the sider binds at about 75 tilt. Adding a light coat of lithium grease didn't help. It will achieve full tilt with a firmer jiggle, but it really should be smooth as silk.One outstanding feature is a heavy paper (vinyl coated) template for marking the wall. Many time companies provide newspaper weight templates, which are not stiff enough to get a reliable mark. This template is also dead on for hole location.All the other aspects of the mount are excellent. I have no doubt it would hold full value of weight specified, and is constructed with no corners cut on quality. The instructions are good, and the installation process is well documented with illustrations and correct. The only thing that could be better for installation is the screw selection provided. Two different lengths of M4, M6 and M8 screws are provided for attaching the rails to the TV, depending on how the back of your TV is constructed. For my TV, the M6 14mm was way to short with a short spacer, and not quite long enough with the 40mm and a long spacer. For my TV, something in between 14 and 40 would allow more threads engaged in the TV.So bottom line is that it's almost perfect for what the specs are, but it would be nice if Sanus would provide all mounts that would fit rather than just one.Kudos to Amazon as well. The price dropped from 249 to 199 two days after my order. One call of 2 minutes resulted in the credit of 50.",David W. Herchenhahn,4
Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,"Strong, Flexible","This is heavy duty so be sure to find wall studs. I put up an older flat screen which was extremely heavy (probably at the weight limit.) It holds wonderfully after some finagling to adjust the TV tilting. Clear yourself plenty of floor space and move things out of your way. Between lots of screws and bolts and tools, you'll want to get the TV out of the way and lay everything out to see. You'll also need your tools like tape measure, stud finder, screwdrivers of various types and sizes. At points this is a two person job such that I held some weight of the TV while my husband lined up screw holes (just to make sure the TV wouldn't tip over - better safe than sorry.) I suppose for the super slim description, it is for all the motion it has. It's very tight so moving up, down, left, right is not as smooth as I'd hoped. The photos show the distance from wall to TV which is the length of a CD, then the photo of the mount extended, then a photo of the part of the mount that is on the wall, then a photo of the mount parts attached to the TV. You will noticed in the next photo that the cable wire attached to the rear of the TV prevents the swivel completely to the left although the next photo shows that the swivel is still quite a bit. Probably just me but I use two hands to move TV in any direction (still getting used to the TV not falling off.) I do love the freedom of sitting in a chair in a corner of the room or sitting on the couch straight on or laying on the couch. Glad we made this purchase on Amazon. Way better price than Best Buy, etc. Shipping was fast, to the door, and packed really well.",Lisa J.,5

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,A great sturdy mount for your flat screen,"Summary- This mount is quality. Its made out of heavy steel and once its mounted you'll have no fear of it falling. Installation is a bit cumbersome and you will want to have 2 people to install it ideally. The one critique I have of this is that it does not allow you to go a full 90 degrees left and right if you need it. Otherwise, its a quality product that will last a lifetime, and somewhat flexible as far as allowing you to mount the tv where your studs arePros -Quality product made of heavy steelVery adjustable, can adjust height, pivot, tilt etcCons-Does not allow for full 90 degree rotationtakes two to installa little expensive for what you get",James H.

This has beautiful finish, is very thin, very adjustable and has nice finishing touches -like a cover plate to hide the screws from mounting on the wall. Just beware that since this is a very thin mount, the power receptacle etc has to be recessed in the wall otherwise you will not be able to push the tv flush against the wall.

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,Sanus Wall Mount,I purchased and installed the Sanus Full Motion wall mount for my 55 LED TV last weekend. The mount itself is a well made mount and is heavy duty. It has no trouble supporting my TV and the installation was pretty straight forward. I installed it by myself and it would have been much easier if I had a second person helping.The cable guides are really meant for routing cables to an outlet directly behind the TV. My outlet was down near the floor and the TV's power cable was much too short to reach when I used the guides. My other issue with the mount is that when the TV is pushed flat against the wall there is no side to side adjustment. You have to pull the TV away from the wall to move it from side to side. They could have also could have added a couple of more mounting slots for the stud bolts to better align with my 16 stud layout.Overall I am happy with the mount as it is sturdy and well made. It is easy to get the TV on and off the mount.,Wader,4

Sanus,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,Ok for light weight TV's only,"My friend bought this mount and asked me to help him install it. He had a 65"" Plasma that weighed 91lbs. This mount says it's ok for this tv and says it'll support up to 125lbs. I install tv's in commercial applications all the time but the mounts I use aren't available in stores and cost about 3 times this mount. I looked at the specifications, at this tv specifications and told him it should be fine. Upon arrival I pulled out the mount, started putting everything together, marked the walls etc and then mounted the back part of the mount. Everything seemed fine. Once we placed the TV on the mount it is apparent the weak point is the bars going across on the top/bottom where the tv attaches. They are super small diameter and provide little support for such a heavy tv. I am ok that the TV isn't going to fall but when you move it around it's super shaky. I viewed the instructions to insure I didn't leave anything off and it's obvious I didn't. I say this mount is fine for any tv under 40"" and less than 50lbs but the 125lb weight is says it'll support would scare me. My friend is giving this a day or so to see if he feels safe and we might just pay more money to get something heavier. I don't know why they put such small diameter cross pieces on this especially when the rest of the mount seems reasonable for the tv sizes and weights it is rated for. I guess the final thing to say is you get what you pay for. For a large heavy tv, the mounts I'm used to using (Chief, Peerless,Omni) are about 400-600 dollars. This one is 1/3 the price but 1/3 the support strength.",CommercialInstaller,2

I feel confident that the mount doesn't feel weak or give you the feeling that it won't hold the TV so I do like it for the different ways it moves and the strength.",jhunt,4

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,The name Ultimate is more than just its brand name,"Ive heard quite a few Bluetooth speakers. Some better than others, but one thing they all lacked was good Bass output. Well that has been more than solved here. But its not just about Bass here. The overall sound quality is outstanding. And while were talking about how great it is how about full Alexa control built in as well? YUP... that too. Connectivity to Pandora, iHeart, Spotify, another others as well ensure you will get plenty of choices when it comes to music. In the box is the of course the BT speaker, power adapter, USB cable, quick start guide, and in my case I got the charging dock as well for free. Im not sure but this might be a Best Buy thing. The speaker itself is a nice graphite color that should match most home entertainment set ups. There is also a Blue one if you want something a little more blingier (probably not a word, but you get what I mean). It weighs almost 3 pounds which I assume is because the speaker has some decent drivers to get that the incredible Bass it puts out. Set up is fairly easy. Just download the Ultimate ears app from your devices app store, log into your Amazon account, turn speaker on and follow the instructions to get the speaker and Alexa features all set up. You can also use manual set up via long pressing the power button for pairing to your chosen device. As stated before one of the coolest features this has over some other BT speakers is voice control. So in addition to a Bass rocking speaker you can use it for all sorts off voice commands. Weather updates, play/ pause music, etc. And to top all of this off it is IP67 Waterproof for up to 30 minutes in 3' of water. Accidentally drop it in your tub while having a relaxing bath, kicked into your pool while playing poolside. No problem. The initial charge can take up to 3 hours and is rated for up to 16 hours. So a full day should be no problem at all. And if you have the dock as well just keep it on the dock and never have to worry about charging it. All day music with Alexa their anytime you need it. This is by far the best sounding, and most feature rich Bluetooth speaker I have ever heard. And will be recommending it to anyone looking for a nice gift this Holiday season. The name “Ultimate” is definitely deserved here!! It is the Ultimate Bluetooth Wi-Fi speaker for sure.",Nate34,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great portable speaker for anywhere,"I have been completely blown away by the performance of this new Megablast portable speaker by Ultimate Ears. I currently own a Boom speaker, which is a previous generation of portable speaker from Ultimate Ears, and this Megablast speaker is a vast improvement in every way. The Megablast looks fairly similar in style to the Boom, with the same cylindrical shape and rubbery feel to the buttons. It is much larger than the Boom. It is advertised as waterproof and this held true when it was tested in a bathtub. This makes it great for outdoor situations, especially for the pool, boat, or camping. The Megablast has far-field voice recognition, reacting to my voice commands from very far away, inside and outside. It can connect either via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It is compatible with Alexa Voice which allows it respond to all of the typical Alexa questions and commands. The speaker currently works with Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, TuneIn (through the Alexa App). Via Bluetooth, you can connect to your phone and play music from the various music services that are out there. There is a free Ultimate Ears app that will need to be downloaded to your phone which walks the user through connecting the speaker and logging in to Amazon and other music services. The speaker does come with a D-ring, Micro USB cord, and power adapter. I also obtained the Ultimate Ears Power Up charging dock which works nicely with the speaker. The Power Up charging dock works with both Megablast and Blast speakers, but not the previous generation of speakers like the Boom. For me, a single charge lasted about fifteen hours. Now about the sound: it is amazing and comes out in all directions. Compared to my old Boom, music sounds more full and rich, even at loud volume levels. The improvement in the bass is the most noticeable. Music has real weight to it that you just don't hear with other portable speakers thanks to the improved bass drivers. The highs, the mid-range, and the lows just sound so good. I have really enjoyed using the Megablast. It is easy to use, has quality sound, and allows me to use Alexa. If you are looking for a quality portable speaker, I highly recommend the Ultimate Ears Megablast.",Robs,5

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Good quality/sound Alexa issues,"I have tried out a bunch of bluetooth speakers over time. As just a speaker this one is pretty good quality. As far as taking the place of my Alexa it is not up to mustard.Get it for a quality portable speaker, and use the Amazon features just as a bonus.The speaker was easy to get started out of the box. Mine also came with a wireless charging pad (great feature to add to the purchase). It connected easy with my phone to play music etc. I had issues getting Alexa up and running at first but that may have been a wifi connection issue. You will be required to use the app for the speaker to connect. The connection is good, and sound quality is good. One thing I noticed with this brand of speaker before (and this one) the volume up/down controls are slow to respond and lead to over-adjusting the volume before it catches up. This is because it's controlling the phone/device volume it's connected to wirelessly and I guess there's a lag. There are only 4 buttons, volume up, down, power, and sync. All self explanatory. The speaker is a little heavy, so while portable, you probably don't want to carry it around. I suggest taking it where you want and sitting in on a table.The charging pad is great. You simply need to replace the screw in hook on the bottom of the speaker with a metal one provided with the base. Then you plug in the base w/ provided cord from the speaker (micro USB). Just sit the speaker on top of the prongs on the base and it charges wirelessly and automatically (also it will turn on automatically, so if you don't want it on you'll have to turn it back off) The only other items to check are the Alexa features. I already have one so if you do too, make sure you keep them in separate rooms. Otherwise they will both play the same thing at the same time when you activate them. The main difference I notice with this speaker Alexa ability vs my original one, is this is a speaker first, so it is connecting to a device to play music from there primarily. When I tried to access online amazon stations it would not do so and would pull from my Google Play phone radio stations instead. This may be an issue with my Amazon music account that doesn't allow additional devices without changing plans. So if you want full function and this is not your only Amazon Alexa device you may have to change your account/plan settings to add a speaker. If this is your only Alexa device then it may work as expected.Size and shape it is about the same as my Amazon Alexa in size/shape and weight. There is no volume spin control, only up/down buttons.Great speaker, okay Alexa, volume adjustments could be a little more responsive.",hokie00,3
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Early Firmware missing features,"MegablastSetup:I encountered firmware update issues during setup - so I had to continue setup & go back to update (took a few times, then was finally successful).Usage / Buttons:You have to be dead center on the large buttons. At the top of the 'volume down' - it feels like you're hitting a button (feels springy), but you're not - you have to go lower and the volume will decrease. The 'volume up' will accept a lower press to raise the volume. Unlike my $99 Wonderboom, you can't pair more of these speakers that are ~3x the price for a better surround sound. Say whaaat?The sound is a typical UE sound - it's really clean & bassy. It's heavy, but it's grippy & portable - I dig it. It has its own independent sound control - so, raising / lowering volume doesn't change the phone's volume as some devices do (which is where you run into the volume being too low - or just a bit too loud). I've had this before & it's nice that the Megablast is not following that example. Charging the unit appears to make you put it on its side to get to the connector and there's no way it'll be able to stand once you hook up the USB cable. Enter the ""POWER UP"" charging dock - which gives you a replacement nut at the bottom allowing standing charging & use. It's an extra $40 or so, but is worth it, should you really use this a ton & don't want the aggravation.Bluetooth Usage:If you're streaming via bluetooth and ask Alexa a question, it kills the bluetooth connection & doesn't auto-reconnect to continue playing.There are Bluetooth reconnect issues too - I use a few BT devices, even a UE Wonderboom, so it's not my first rodeo. If I disconnect from those, I can reconnect without issue. With this Megablast, sometimes I have to cycle Bluetooth on my phone & then it works. And I'll hear some static during the reconnect too, which is odd. ""Alexa"" Features:Voice recognition is 4/5 times successful for acknowledging that it heard me. Via the UE App, you can toggle the 'microphone off' - so it's not always listening (small red light appears on the top at the bluetooth button). There is no tone to let you know it has heard the wake word (it should be an option at least), but the top light blinks.It can't tell how much battery remains: ""I don't have a battery.""As of Mid-November 2017, there was no Pandora integration yet - though it responds like it's getting my station - but voices an error. There must be an update coming soon (fingers crossed!).It doesn't work well with Amazon Prime Music. It says it's going to shuffle my collection, but it pauses for a long time and then only sometimes starts playing, then cuts out.Smart-ish Home Thoughts ... I could control my HUE lights via room names & the ever finicky Harmony Hub without issue, just as my Tap does - no issues seen here. So, the recommendation is a ""yes"" for the sound - you just need to be patient & hope that these 'smart' quirks get worked out soon.",nhtechie,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Alexa Done Right!,"If this were a 'NEW' device I would perhaps write a lengthy review but instead it is the fusion/upgrade of a product that has been around for a few years. My best friend received the original Echo back when it first launched and it was pretty sweet though something I didn't really feel the need to own especially since I didn't think it was THAT great of a speaker. I have several Bluetooth speakers but I am always looking for the next and best. With the Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST I feel like I have found that speaker.The UE MEGABLAST (you just have to put that in all caps), is an outstanding Bluetooth speaker. It is by far, the clearest and probably loudest speaker I have every owned (minus my old component system back in the day). Add to that the Alexa functionality and it makes this a no-brainer. I do a lot of cooking and my wife likes to bake so to now have a speaker that we can command with our voices and can fill the entire lower floor of our house with great music, is a wonderful thing. I probably won't be using all of the features of Alexa but I have already enjoyed checking the local traffic and weather in the mornings before heading out to work.I'm betting I will also never have the opportunity to fully test out the waterproofing since I plan to keep this inside most of the time and I don't have a pool, but since it is in the kitchen I at least don't have to worry about it getting splashed.Set-up was a breeze. I didn't even do it the right way and was still up and running in less than 5 minutes. I plugged in the MEGABOOM and paired it with my iPhone and the phone prompted me to download the Ultimate Ears app, once that was downloaded it did a quick 30 sec firmware update and I was ready to sign into my Amazon account. 20 seconds later I had the speaker jamming out some Def Leppard and I was good.I HIGHLY recommend the Power Up base accessory since it makes it a lot easier to keep this thing charged since you just have to leave or drop it on the dock. The white base is nice and I actually didn't even have to use the 'brick' that the MEGABLAST came with, I just have the USB cord going into a power port built into my plug outlet. No muss and no fuss. When I want to take it outside or to the beach I can just grab it and go and know that it is charged up. UE says that you can get 16 hours on a charge and I have yet to test that out but it has gone strong for over 7 so far.If you have been thinking about getting an Alexa capable device and have been holding off, don't. Ultimate Ears has created a top notch Bluetooth speaker that deserves to be bought just for that but then ices the cake by adding Amazon Alexa functionality.",Wraith,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great speaker with a few flaws,"Ultimate Ears - MEGABLAST Smart Portable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Speaker is definitely a contender for one of the best bluetooth speakers I've ever heard. The sound is crisp, clear, and LOUD. Louder than any other speaker I feel like I've tested. The nice thing about the speaker is that even though it reaches unreached levels of sound, it doesn't get too blown out at the higher levels. Sometimes static and fuzz can occur and I hear none of it. Like the new Bose speakers, the sound is projected in a circular fashion which I absolutely love. Being able to hear the music from any part of the room as if you were right next to it is a great accomplishment. The packaging on the speaker is slick and the unit itself is very robust and heavy. I like the fact that the speaker is waterproof, but it will be a while before I put that to the test. The only real thing that bugged me about the speaker is the APP that the company forces you to use to setup the device. I had issues getting it to recognize the speaker, installing the updates and even pairing with WIFI. Repeatedly I had to restart the app and sometimes it just would not pair with the device at all. Finally I just got it to pair with bluetooth and turned off the app, so as of now I don't use the Alexa function. I don't really use Alexa so it's not a big deal to me, but the hassle from the app itself makes me not even want to try and finish the process. So that to me is the only real detriment to the device. Other than that I think it is a great quality speaker that competes with any of the other bluetooth speakers I've heard out in today's market. You can't go wrong with this one, but I hope they update and fix the bugs in the App soon, cause it hurts the experience!",couponkingofjax,4

The setup is easy and the huge plus is it has Alexa. If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker, portable, long battery life and Alexa this is the speaker to get.",AudioFan,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Ultimate Ears Losing Focus?,"I own quite a few different speakers from portable Bluetooth speakers to home speakers with integrated voice assistants. The UE Megablast tries to be the jack of all trades, but falls a bit short.UNBOXING:The unboxing experience is simple and pleasant. Without getting into too much detail of the packaging, you're greeted with a speaker, a high-quality flat microUSB cable, and an AC adapter. You can also purchase a charging dock separately which will allow you to drop the Megablast onto the dock for charging without fiddling with cables. Additionally, you can continue to use the Megablast while charging.SETUP:To setup the Megablast, I downloaded the Ultimate Ears app on my smartphone and opened it up. After ensuring Bluetooth was enabled on my smartphone, I turned on the Megablast. From there, you can pair using the app or your phone's pairing menu. After pairing over Bluetooth, the app will continue the setup process.The Wi-Fi connectivity setup process is simple, but only if your home network situation is typical. Ultimate Ears recommends having separate SSID's for each network (e.g. MyWiFi 2.4GHz, MyWiFi 5GHz) so that the Megablast doesn't get confused during setup. I found that following this recommendation led to a successful setup for the Wi-Fi connectivity. After selecting your network and entering the password, you're also given the opportunity to login to Amazon Alexa for the voice assistant functionality. The app will also install any firmware updates during this process.APP:Once the setup is complete, the app is very simple. You have the ability to turn off the microphone for Alexa to work, and you have the ability to see the battery status, Wi-Fi connection status, Bluetooth connection status and Alexa sign-in status. You also have the ability to switch Wi-Fi networks, switch Amazon accounts for Alexa integration, or unpair/forget the Megablast. Lastly, you can change the idle-time before shutdown, the speaker language, and toggle firmware auto-updates.MEGABLAST HARDWARE:The Megablast is pretty simple. It has a power button with an LED in it, a pairing button, and volume down/up buttons. And of course, the 360 degree sound people love so much paired with an IP67 water resistance rating for splashes and even a bit of submersion. However, it does not have a 3.5mm jack—a feature found on the smaller UE BOOM.AUDIO QUALITY:Like the BOOM speakers that preceded it, the Megablast has sparkly highs, clear mid-range, and punchy bass. However, the Megablast starts to fall short at the highest volumes, as compression kicks in to prevent clipping/distortion in the bass frequencies. This is due to the fact that the EQ really pushes the bass on the Megablast, but like any other Bluetooth speaker, it can only physically handle so much—so to prevent damage, it compresses the bass at a certain threshhold. When this happens, the bass sounds either anaemic or uncontrolled. I do want to stress that this happens to most portable Bluetooth speakers, and the Megablast far from the worst of them.Despite this, if you're listening to spacious, dynamic music, then the Megablast will sound fantastic at most volumes. I have gotten the chance to listen to progressive rock, metal, acoustic, swing jazz, big band jazz, EDM and more. Music with more dynamic instrumentation really shines on the Megablast. Music with a constantly hot master may start to lose its clarity when the Megablast is set to its highest volumes. But overall, an excellent listening experience.ALEXA INTEGRATION:I'm not a fan of Alexa, personally. I find that switching between Bluetooth and Alexa is not seamless. Once I call out ""Alexa"", the Megablast disconnects from Bluetooth, so I have to pair my phone again if I want to use it. Despite this, you can use Alexa with a limited number of unpopular streaming services. You can control Alexa's volume, but not your Bluetooth volume. You also can't ask for the battery status using Alexa. It helps to think of Alexa as a standalone assistant that knows nothing of its existent in the Megablast. When using Alexa, the ""Megablast"" is irrelevant. It only knows whatever Alexa knows and can only do whatever Alexa can do—except stream from Spotify for some reason. So the lesson here is that if you are using Alexa, don't expect Bluetooth connectivity to resume. Just stick to Alexa's Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn streaming over Wi-Fi. Oh, and just so we're clear, Alexa only works over Wi-Fi.CONCLUSION & FINAL THOUGHTS:So, is it worth the price? I'm not sure. I own portable Bluetooth speakers in the same price range, and the Megablast packs a better sound and more volume, but its Alexa integration is half-baked and its missing the integrated voice that tells the battery status when you hold both the volume up and down buttons at the same time. On top of that, you can't do party mode with multiple Megablasts, you can't do remote power on, and you can't change the EQ. These are all features of the smaller UE BOOM, so I'm rather confused as to why these features aren't available on the Megablast. If you're buying this speaker for the Alexa integration, forget it. But if you want a great Bluetooth speaker with a few missing features compared to its smaller siblings, this could be the one to rock your parties.",Xephyroth,3
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Do not recommend this product,"We purchased this item in November. It took us a few weeks before we set it up and by January it wasn't charging any longer. I contacted their customer service by Feb. 3. They were very responsive at first but three weeks went by without responding to my email. I called today and was told they never received my email and I needed to provide the information again. Once they review it, I will need to return the speaker to them before they will provide a new speaker. If you don't mind having your unit fail after light use for two months and jump through a bunch of hoops to get a replacement and not having your speaker for a few months, then this unit is fine.",Denisara,1
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Alexa is great,"The best part about this speaker is Alexa and the connectivity of smart devices. The sound is crisp and clear even at max level but the bass is minimal at best. At very low volumes the bass actually sounds pretty decent. The audio resonates very well from this speaker and it's difficult to pinpoint exactly where the sound is coming from which is great. Projects well and is very clear. When playing audio with Alexa everything functions beautifully, but connect to bluetooth and you will wish for a headphone jack on your phone. Range is great but connecting and staying connected is a pain. I am hoping a firmware update will fix this since I think this has plenty of potential. The life proofing is great and makes this an ideal outdoor speaker.",Oldskool,3
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Amazing product,"I don't get excited about products very often, but the Ultimate Ears Megablast speaker is a truly amazing product.First and foremost, it's a speaker. And as such I'm amazed at the sound quality that comes from it. When they say 360 degree sound, they mean it. It literally fills the room with sound. Not just sound, but a rich, full sound with plenty of bass. I am very impressed with both the quality and the volume this thing puts out.Amazon Alexa has been a new, pleasant experience for me. She responds to just about anything you ask her. There is a little bit of a lag, so don't be in a hurry. So far I've enjoyed having Alexa play my favorite music just by asking. And if I need a little extra volume, I just have to ask. I'm hoping I can figure out how to have her control my internet connected garage door opener.And, of course, you can connect to the Megablast using Bluetooth--up to 8 different devices from computers to cell phones. There are just 4 buttons--volume up and down, power, and Bluetooth. Simple. Combining these buttons provides additional functionality.I also like the fact that it's wireless--up to 16 hours. I recommend the charging dock, as well, which makes it super easy to charge just by setting it on the dock.If you want a speaker that delivers amazing sound quality with lots of volume wherever you are, the Megablast is going to be hard to beat. Alexa is icing on the cake.",MichaelM,5

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great BT Speaker! Isn't Perfect However...,"The new UE Megablast is a newcomer to the UE lineup. Now I have never owned a product in this lineup however I have seen an overall positive impression so I was excited to try it out for myself. This speaker promises omnidirectional sound output, waterproof ability, and the new Amazon Alexa capabilities.What’s In the Box? (The box has a REALLY neat design!)-UE Megablast speaker-Quick Start Guide-Micro USB cable-USB ChargerDesign: The cylindrical design is not new to me however this size is. It is fairly large in length and girth. The speakers are covered with a metal mesh where the two 25mm tweeters, two 55mm drivers, and two 85mm x 50mm passive radiators pass sound through. On the bottom of the speaker is a circular rubber cover protecting the micro usb port for charging. There is also a removable D-ring underneath the speaker which is also used for charging using the optional charging base. (Not included) Up top is the power button which is a straight line that illuminates. The oversized volume buttons were VERY hard for me to locate when I first used the device. Well the end up being RIGHT in front of you. I had a couple comments about the buttons resembling a religious cross. Features:- Rugged Design - Omnidirectional Sound (Fairly new to the market although not my first speaker)- Up to 16 hrs battery life- IP67 rating- STRONG Bluetooth Connection. I was able to go to any corner of my house and the speaker didnt hesitate a bit. Other speakers typically did cut in and out or stop altogether.- Wifi music streaming from IHeartRadio, Amazon Prime Music, and TuneIn Radio through Amazon Alexa. Pandora and Deezer are hopefully coming in the near future. - Integrated Amazon Alexa voice assistantAudio Quality: One thing I noticed as soon as this speaker started to play music was its overpowering volume level ability. This speaker was able to get LOUD! I wasnt expecting such an ability out of something this (relatively) small. Now this isnt the only speaker I have in this price range that can do this but it is the first to do it well. The mids and highs are very sharp. Very little distortion while turning the volume up. The bass however does become slightly distorted and cannot get the same depth as my Addon T3 speaker can. The Addon T3 won awards for sound quality in the past so it doesnt surprise me but it is something to note. The Megablast does get louder than the Addon T3 and is not directional so it has the overall win in my book but I love the classy design and sound quality of the Addon better.Problems: I did have very weird ""Auto"" connection problems with the UE. It would randomly connect to my phone while just sitting on the counter AFTER the speaker was turn off. I found this annoying but it seemed to go away after a couple days. Im also not a huge fan of the fact this came with Amazon Alexa capabilities because you need an Amazon account to participate with the feature but I have a Google Mini that fulfills those need overall. Another problem is the charging brick, its huge! It must be plugged in the TOP outlet for the bottom one to be usable at all. Its way to big... Overall: I think this speaker has very good sound quality and with the omnidirectional sound is a bonus. The waterproofing benefits can be a huge benefit if you plan to take your $300 speaker with you wherever you go but mine will likely stay at home with the occasional outing. A solid speaker I would definitely tell others to take a look at if your in the market.",Justin,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,LOUD!,"When selecting this particular line of UE be aware you will no longer be able to pair multiple speakers through the UE app as it’s “UE Boom” series. For now the speaker is strictly WiFi as well as Bluetooth capable. Takes a little playing around with the app to pair it with your home WiFi but once paired works fine with Alexa. Extremely portable, although TSA will make you take it out of your back pack at security checkpoints. Sound quality is amazing!! Battery lasts either very long (6-8hours, on low volume)... or very limited (1-2hours of play, on moderately high volume) no distortion and very clear sound and the bass bumps as well. Overall it’s an awesome portable and rugged/ waterproof speaker.",Jacktl5i,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Not ready for primetime,"I was really excited about this speaker, but unfortunately this is the worst bluetooth speaker I've ever used. The sound quality is clean and crisp. Has some bass, but not a lot. The issue seems to be it's ability to keep a connection, and the Alexa support. It's very buggy and needs work. Whenever I have my phone paired to the speaker via Bluetooth, then ask the speaker a question using it's builtin Alexa feature, I hear nothing but hiss and static. When I go back to playing music, the sound will be from my phone only. I have to repair the Bluetooth connection. I have to do this every time I attempt to ask the speaker a question. The Alexa feature doesn't seem to work at all. If I ask it a question, I get 10 seconds of hissing noise. They have an Android app. It appears many people are having issues with their app. The rating for their app is quite low, with numerous complaints. I can't recommend this speaker at the moment. Perhaps an update will address these issues.",CDF3,1

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,"Great Sound and Build Quality, but...","The speaker is amazing. UE makes great products and the Megablast is no different. Quality all the way around. From the packaging to the build quality to the overall sound. A+ across all of those areas. The only thing that left me wanting more, was the Bass. From a speaker this size, I was sort of disappointed in the quality of the Bass.My unit came with the speaker and the table top charging dock. The packaging is incrdible, and makes sure your product is not going to be damaged in any way during delivery/shipping. To cable charge, you simply plug in the supplied USB cable into the bottom of the unit. To charge with the docking station, you simply screw in a charging station cap on the bottom and place directly on top of the charger. The initial charge took quite a long time, and was not fully charged from the factory. But once charged the battery life has been great. UE says a full charge can last 15+ hours, and if you download and connect to the UE App, you can always see how much charge you have left, so you're not stuck with a dead speaker at the wrong time.Setting up the speaker was super fast and simple. Normal bluetooth pairing was immediate to my Note 8. I downloaded the UE App as well and while it looks polished, it felt sort of glitchy. The app recognized the speaker immediately but had trouble running through the rest of the setup. I had to exit the app and start over twice before it let me finish the setup. Not a huge deal to be concerned with, as i'm sure UE will fix the app over time. It's also nice that the speaker can be connected via wi-fi and bluetooth. And you can set it to update itself via wi-fi automatically.Setting up Alexa was also a breeze. Simply go to the Alexa setup in the App and login with your Amazon Alexa account and that's it. Alexa is immediately available on your Megablast. We also have a few Amazon Echos in the home, and using the Megablast with Alexa felt the same as using the Echo device. Speech recognition was very good even from across the room. All the features of Alexa are right here in the Megablast, and portable, unlike a Echo/Echo Plus. I think we'll use the Megablast so much more, simply because we can move it around with us.Build quality is amazing, the speaker is huge and feels very sturdy and almost heavy in the hand. Very nice. The 360 degrees sound field is also great, and you get room filling sound and great volume levels. Sound quality is also very good, as you'd expect from UE. But, from a speaker of this size and build, I honestly expected more Bass. I have numerous bluetooth speakers, some bigger or smaller, some from UE and other brands. Compared to all my other speakers, the Megablast was just ok on Bass response. Don't get me wrong, the Bass is there, and for most it's probably fine. However when listening to bass heavy audio, even when EQ'd, the Bass simply gets compressed and tight, not boomy. i don't think it would be a reason to not get the Megablast, the overall sound of the speaker is amazing, but if you were thinking that a speaker this size would give you over the top Bass, you might be disappointed. Having IP67 weather sealing is nice so you don't have to be worried about getting it wet.A couple things I wish they would have done better; you cannot pair multiple Megablast speakers together in stereo, which for this price and category seems to be a glaring omission, I hope UE fixes that soon. I also wish that the speaker came with a 3.5mm connector, but it does not, wireless all the way, or nothing. When using Alexa, the only way you know Alexa has been triggered is if you're actually looking at the speaker and can see the LED light on top grow brighter, there is no audible tone that tells you Alexa is ready, like when using an Amazon Alexa device.All in all the UE Megablast is an amazing speaker with Amazing features, and integrating Alexa just kicks it up a notch! I'm very impressed with the Megablast overall.",HarvickFan,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great speaker and Alexa works well,"The Megablast is a great sounding speaker that gets very loud (93 dB) without distorting. It’s quite heavy so even though it’s “portable” you will definitely know you’re hauling it around. I highly recommend the power up base for convenience and because charging is a bit wonky without it (the charging port is located on the bottom under a flap). Alexa works flawlessly except when the volume is high which is to be expected. As of right now, UE and Amazon are teaming up to give you 3 free months of Amazon Music Unlimited Family Plan which is a nice bonus. Unlike prior UE speakers, there’s no party mode over Bluetooth but it is available as long as you are on WiFi. Setting up the speaker is very easy when using the app and direct Bluetooth pairing is painless. The only thing I’d fault with this unit is the seeming inability to adjust the bass, mid and treble levels. Even a basic equalizer would be nice to have. At higher volumes the bass tends to drop off and the sound gets too tweeter heavy for my tastes. Putting the speaker nearer a wall or corner alleviates this some but that’s not always ideal. The 360 degree sound output is quite handy and I’m looking forward to using this during pool season, especially since it’s waterproof. Overall I’ve been quite impressed and would highly consider buying another one in the near future.",Chadwick,5

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great overall portable speaker and Alexa device!,"I was given a free unit in exchange for an unbiased review.Honestly, I'm not sure what's turned out to be better for our family regarding the Ultimate Ears -- MEGABLAST! speaker -- the fact that the audio is quite room-filling or the Amazon Alexa functionality that's built in.Regarding the speaker, per se, for the size, portability and quality of this device, you really can't go wrong -- Logitech bought Ultimate Ears some years ago, so that speaks to the overall culture. It has very good lows, mids and highs for a Bluetooth speaker; turning it all the way up never completely pegged any of the sound frequencies like is possible with lower-quality devices. While we haven't done it yet, we think this might be a great speaker for outdoor movie nights (one of the reasons why we went after the unit to test it).Connectivity was a breeze through the Ultimate Ears app in terms of setup. This was also our family's first foray into Amazon Alexa territory, and the device certainly doesn't disappoint. Asking simple commands -- or ""skills,"" as is Amazon parlance -- does allow for Alexa to retrieve data and perform simple commands with Internet access (the only caveat with Amazon Alexa is that it will respond anytime anyone says, ""Hey, Alexa,"" even if it's over TV!). And since it's software-upgradable via firmware, future integrations continue to come down the pike.We're definitely looking forward to many years' worth of usage from this device, both inside and outside of the house.",PhilGA,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Amazing Sound!,The sound from this small speaker is unbelievable.

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Wow!,"I have had several different bluetooth speakers over the years including Anker and Lifepoof. This is my first Ultimate Ears speaker and all I can say is 'Wow!'. Seriously, this speaker is impressive. It is waterproof and drop proof from around 1 meter up. It is solid, fairly heavy, and feels very premium. It has 16 hours of battery life at mid volume and built-in wi-fi for Alexa use. Let's start with audio quality since that is why you buy a bluetooth speaker. It is nothing short of marvelous in that department. Easily the best sounding bluetooth speaker I have ever heard. Great highs, mids, and very acceptable lows. The two 55mm drivers coupled with the two tweeters do a remarkable job filling a room with clear, musical sound. Plus, this thing gets VERY loud. It easily fills my first floor with sound. Even at max volume there is minimal distortion with bass heavy music which is a real plus. Once you install the app on your mobile device you can get Alexa up and running in no time. I have several Alexa enabled devices in my home ranging from Hue lights and Harmony remote controls to vacuums and sprinkler system. It works them all just like an Echo and the mic easily picks me up from the other side of my house even (albeit at a raised voice). I also have the charging base which is a must in my opinion if you plan to use the Alexa controls as well as keep it portable too. It's a shame the base doesn't come with it for the price.Overall, I can't recommend this speaker enough. Yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for in this case. Outside of a Sonos speaker (which isn't truly portable) I haven't heard a better battery powered Alexa enabled speaker (bluetooth or not). It really is fantastic.",Balthazar2k4,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,"Fantastic Sound, nice integration with Alexa","I’ve used multiple Bluetooth speakers in my years and I would say that the MEGABLAST rates right up there in the top.The most important feature to me off the bat is the music quality. I listen primarily to classic rock and heavy metal and the highs on the output were very crisp. The bass was very punchy and pronounced but I felt at times that the the low end wasn’t filling in on louder volumes (full disclosure, I tend to listen to music loud!)When I listened to acoustic songs, the crisp sound sounded beautiful and it was a very pleasurable experience.The unit structure itself is incredible solid. I like when electronics have a dense feel, the only thing I would say is that it actually packs some weight behind it! I also found the battery life to be phenomenal!The app itself is a little cumbersome in the flow of things while using an iPhone, and other apps didn’t stream out (like Instagram videos), but maybe there’s a little more tweaking I have to go through.This is the first time that Uve really used Alexa and I have to say I just might try it more and more! The microphone picked up my voice pretty easily (even while playing music at my high volunes) which was a huge plus!Overall I recommend anyone looking for a solid and rugged base, nice sounding music, and especially if you are hooked into Amazon’s Alexa!",BGWolf,4

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,missing some streaming services,"This is an all-around great speaker, but I can't give it five stars when it doesn't stream Pandora or Spotify. Yes, it still works fine as a bluetooth speaker, but the main reason for getting the WiFi-capable speaker is the ability to stream music without a phone. Sure, you need WiFi to use the Alexa integration, but to me that's secondary. Supposedly, other services will be added in the future, but at the time of this review, neither of my favorites would stream.Initial setup was a little janky. I downloaded the wrong app at first since there are multiple UE apps, but after connecting via bluetooth, my iPhone prompted me to download the correct one. I could have saved that initial search and incorrect download by connecting first. I also had issues connecting over my WiFi at work. It initially connected fine, but when I went through the immediate firmware upgrade, it couldn't reconnect because it said WEP was unsupported. I did the update over my phone's hotspot, then it was able to reconnect to my work WiFi. One nice thing about the 360 degree sound output is that if you don't like looking at the giant plus and minus symbols on the front of the speaker, you can just turn those toward the wall, and it still sounds great. I personally recommend getting the charging base, otherwise the charging port is awkward to get to if you want to leave it plugged in and charging.",bradcon,4

The Megablast is essentially an upgraded version of the Megaboom and it gets even better with the addition of Alexa support. Setup is dead simple. You download the Ultimate Ears app and launch it and it will automatically discover the speaker if it’s already turned on. It will ask for your wifi information and then your Amazon account to setup Alexa if you like. It's dead simple. You can still skip this if you would prefer to use just Bluetooth. It will also check for updates, so the speaker software can improve over time. Hopefully this means we will see support for more music services.The design is what I have come to expect from the UE line. It has the same woven cloth mesh all the way around with large rubber volume buttons. It’s waterproof so you can take this to the beach or let it float in the bathtub at home.The audio quality is top notch. Sound is clear with punch bass that is impressive in a portable speaker. It's just an all around solid sounding speaker. The voice control for music works great especially if you are an Amazon Prime Music user. If you are a Spotify user unfortunately there is not full support, so you won't be using your voice to play any tracks from the service. Since this is just like any Echo device you can control any smart home devices, set timers, as for the weather, etc. The Megablast’s microphone’s are sensitive enough to pick up my voice, but if the music is turned up loud and I am more than 20-30 feet away I will have to yell for it to hear me. If you want privacy you can disable the mic from the app, though it would have been nice to have a physical button like most other voice assistant enable devices. Finally, there is a nifty dock to enable easy charging. Just swap the connector on the bottom and set the speaker on the platform.",camdenk,5

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Alexa On Steroids,"I own a Google Home and I have played around with an Amazon Echo at my local Best Buy. Both are really good personal assistant devices but I was frankly underwhelmed by each device’s audio quality particularly when it comes to music playback. As a result I was excited to get the Ultimate Ears Megablast with the expectation of exceptional sound quality. The Megablast come nicely packaged and includes a power adapter, a usb cable, and some basic instructions. You need the Ultimate Ears app from either the Apple app store or the Google Play store to complete setup. Within the app one simply connects the Megablast to your WiFi network, pair Bluetooth devices, and sign into your Amazon account and you’re up and running. Can’t beat that for simplicity. I started off by asking Alexa some standard personal assistant questions like the time and weather then quickly moved on to music. I have an Amazon Music Unlimited account so I start requesting songs. I pump up the volume using the + control on the side of the device and I’m quickly blown away by the sound quality emanating from the Megablast. I put it through it paces by requesting various music selections from rock, to jazz, to classical. What a treat! Great music reproduced with great quality by simply asking Alexa. Deep bass and clean rich highs filled my house. Even on the max volume there was no distortion. This thing rocks. One disappointment I discovered which you should be aware of if you use Amazon Music Unlimited. Amazon offers a reduced pricing option called Amazon Echo monthly which limits your account to just one Echo device. It appears that this plan is only available on Echo devices and not on licensed devices such as the Megablast. I hope this changes in the future since Amazon support was even surprised that it didn’t work. I should point out another discovery that the Megablast powers off when not in use. I thought initially that this was a disappointing limitation for a personal assistant device until I found the setting in the app to change this auto sleep feature in time increments of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 Hour, 3 hours, or never. You will get 16 hours of constant use on the never sleep setting. Impressive! Buyers should note that Ultimate Ears also sells a great charging dock accessory for the Megablast called the Ultimate Ears Power Up. This let’s you leave it on at all time while also maintaining a full charge for when you want to take the Megablast with you. When you do the unit is big but is still quite portable. I was happy to learn that the Megablast is also water resistant. Not only that but you could immerse in water up to 3 feet deep for 30 minutes. Why you would want to submerge such an expensive device is beyond me but hey you can if you want. As I used the device for several days one issue stood out. While the Magablast boasts a multiple microphone design with beam forming technology I found myself constantly repeating myself to get Alexa to respond. Very frustrating. I’m hoping that this is improved with a firmware update. Other than this one issue I was truly impressed by the Ultimate Ears Megablast. I would definitely recommend particularly for music lovers seeking excellent sound quality.",PG460,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great sound/portability but not Echo replacement,"We bought this hoping to get the best of both worlds of Amazon echo and Bluetooth speaker. It does great at the latter but only ok at the former.Setup was super easy but had to be done thru an app. I don't believe there was any other way to set it up. As a speaker it sounds incredible. We used it at a Birthday party in a medium to large space and it easily filled the room. Things got a little tinny when we tried to see how loud it would go but in good news it went really loud. Where this speaker fails is as an Echo replacement. There is no way to leave it plugged in to use as a constant Alexa option. The charging port is on the bottom, under a weather proof flap and the cord isn't flexible enough to allow you to flip it back over and stand up regular. It's really meant to be a portable speaker at which it does excel. But then the other issue with using it as a portable speaker for Alexa is that it auto powers off after 15 minutes of no activity or use. So unless you're paying music constantly or asking Alexa to tell you the weather or stock prices every 14.5 minutes, you have to power the thing on to ask Alexa something. Far less than ideal.So it's because of the latter issue with Alexa being barely functional we'll be returning it and buying an actual Echo.",Junior,3

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,"Awesome Sound, perfect for the outdoors with Alexa","This speaker is loud. From the tech specs, the speaker has a max output of 93 decibels, which is a 40% increase, can I tell if it is 40% louder, not sure but I can be a good 30-50 feet and have no problems hearing the speaker when I compared it to other Bluetooth speakers that I had. For me the sound reaches everywhere in my back yard and my back yard is about a half acre. It has 360 coverage and it really didn't matter where I was in my back yard, the music sounded great from all angles. It sounds very clear and doesn't have that muddy sound you hear on other speakers when you turn up the volume all of the way. Wifi is rated at 330 feet for wifi and 150 for Bluetooth. I could reach a signal anywhere in my yard and I had a solid Bluetooth connection from 35 feet or so. No drop outs and the sound was great. Battery life is good. One thing I like is that the charger is wireless charging dock so I could really charge the speaker anywhere I went and it gave it a nice base to keep off the table. The battery is rated for 16 hours and I got close to that, but I was near a strong wifi signal and I kept the volume level at about half. I am not sure what happens to the battery life if it is not near a strong wifi signal, but battery life does take a hit if you play at max levels. Alexa is built in so you get hands free access to music services such as Amazon music, iHeartRadio and TuneIn. It looks like Pandora and Deezer will work in the near future. You get access to other Alexa services such as news, weather, auidiobooks, voice control for IoT devices, general questions and 25,000 Alexa commands. Set up is through a new UE app which connects your wifi network and links you Amazon account for the Alexa functions. Since the speaker is WiFi capable, the speaker will get updates quickly for Alexa functions. One of the benefits about being connected to wifi is now your music won't stop when someone is calling you. The Pros:More durable and portable version of the EchoMuch louder and clearer than an EchoSounds much clearer at loud levels, doesn't sound muddyIP67 water resistant. Alexa is always listening no more having to press a button Some Cons:There is no head phone jack, I know not everyone uses one and a speaker is typically so everyone can hear it, but some people will want the earphone access. Can't link older UE speakers and for now you can only play music through one Megablast at a time. Right now only Amazon Music, iHeartRadios and TuneIn are available for streaming music directly. Pandora and Deezer are set to be in the future. So if you use Apple music or Spotify you are out of luck. Can't make Alexa phone calls. I really like this speaker, one of the better sounding ones at full volume. If you need a loud, great sounding portable speaker that has Alexa functions built in so you can be hands free and is water resistant, this is the speaker for you.",giper54,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,It’s ‘ok’,UE took away features for a louder speaker and added Alexa. If you have music playing you’ll have to yell at the speaker for it to hear you. Battery life is average,U2rob73,3
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,"Sound is MEGA, but BLAST the bugs!","I own and have used the Ultimate Ears Boom speaker that I've had for the past 5-6 years or so and it has been my favorite bluetooth speaker I've ever had. After hearing about this new Ulimate Ears MEGABLAST speaker, I was thrilled and couldn't wait to receive it in the mail. I knew this would be my new permanent replacment for my aging BOOM speaker, with the increasingly dwindling battery. But, a few bugs and inconsistencies keep it from exceeding my expectations. It'll still be my new daily-use speaker.First of all, let me explain why the original UE BOOM was my favorite speaker. I've got some hearing loss issues and my right ear has only about 15% hearing (it's really only good for picking up bass, lol). So, when I choose a new speaker or pair of headphones/earbuds, they have to be able to get loud enough for a comfortable level for me, but yet even louder when I want to ""crank"" it. I use all my bluetooth devices on my iPad Pro 10.5"" and my new iPhone X. The BOOM speaker has never failed me. I watch Twitch.tv daily, usually for about 6 hours on average while I do my work. I've used my BOOM for many years like this and I've only kept the volume up between the 3-4 notch (this is maybe 1/3 the max volume on the device volume bar) for everything I listen to and never had an issue hearing.So, I was definitely excited to get this. I couldn't wait to unbox it, get it charged and synced to my devices! Let's break it down.Packaging:This was where I was most impressed. The packaging on the outside didn't look like anything fancy. But, it's when you break the seal and pull the slip-cover off the box... The inside box the speaker is housed in is made of a super thick and durable cardboard and I was totally not expecting the amazing artwork! It's so bright and colorful and I immediately thought - they've put a lot of love into this making and designing this speaker and box. Inside the box, the cylindrical speaker is nestled in perfectly curved black styrofoam and matches everthing else. It's very snug and secure. Along with the speaker, you also get the normal, minimal instructions (it's a bluetooth speaker, not rocket science), USB power cable and the larger-than-my-old-one power brick. The cable and brick are both white, perfectly contrasting with the black speaker.Design:This speaker looks nearly identical to my old one, aside from a few minor color differences and the obvious fact that it is MUCH bigger. The top of the speaker has the power button and the bluetooth sync button. On the front, non-mesh part of the speaker are the + and - buttons for the volume. Then, down at the very bottom...ON the bottom, lies the flip-up waterproofing rubber flap. You have to pull this up in order to get to the USB charge port and Power LED charge indicators. This flap was a little tighter to pull up than I would have liked (I thought I was going to rip it once...) and you definitely have to pull it back a bit with some force in order to plug the charge cable into it. The only other negative to this is given the fact that all this is on the bottom of the speaker, you have the lay it down on it's side while it is charging. Again, the same as my old one. But...you know, round things...well, they roll. Aside from this, I absolutely love the tall, cylinder shape of the speaker and the minimal amount of space it takes!App:Once I got the speaker fully charged, I was able to connect it via Bluetooth to my iPad Pro 10.5"" (my primary Twitch.tv watching device) without fail. I downloaded the app designed for the BLAST range of speakers. It looks really nice and has all the normal options I'd expect. The app detected the speaker and after I entered my WiFi password, it even automatically updated the firmware. It then asked me to activate Alexa and log into my Amazon account, which I was able to do without any problems...then gave me a code for a few months free of Amazon Music. I use Spotify myself, but still - not a bad gesture. After the inital setup, the app displays the current battery level in a bar-style format (not a percentage), confimration of WiFi connection and Alexa on/off, as well as the link to my Amazon account. Other than that, it's pretty basic, but gives you the information you need.However, my major issue with the battery level on this speaker is that you can ONLY view it through the app. My old BOOM speaker displayed the battery at the top of my device, as well as in my Battery Widget. This speaker does neither. It just shows that ""headphone"" icon at the top of my device with no battery indicator and does not appear anywhere in my Batteries info in settings or the Widget. I'm hoping this is just a software bug and will be fixed in a later update, as it's quite annoying coming from my BOOM speaker that does show this. Then again, it could be intentional since you can just ask Alexa ""what's my battery at?""...Bluetooth/Alexa/Sound:I'm tying these final three into one category because it's seems that they are all somehow related together and where my biggest concerns are. This is where the the bugs and inconsistencies hide, aside from my issue with the Battery indicator above. The bluetooth has EXCELLENT range, but it doesn't appear to be flawless, like I'm used to with other Ultimate Ear products. When it has a connection, it's great and solid. No cut-outs or any other weird sound artifacts. However, I've had a few instances where the bluetooth connection would just drop for no reason. This seemed a little inconsistent, with no rhyme or reason for it. Completely random. I have to manually go into settings and select the MEGABLAST speaker to connect it again.This is my first Alexa enabled device! So, I was definitly excited to give it a try. Initially, Alexa was a joy to use. I started with all the obvious stuff you would ask something like Alexa or Siri. ""How's the weather today?"" granted me exactly what I wanted to hear, plus more in a voice that I found rather pleasing compared to say, Siri. Alexa just seems much more natural and non-robotic. Then I go on with having her tell me a joke, rap, etc, etc. All works great. But...I discovered an issue with using Alexa while playing music or any audio already coming through the speaker. When the speaker is playing audio and you issue an Alexa command...when she's done...the bluetooth connection just.........DROPS. Every. Single. Time. I have to go into settings and reconnect. So, the only time I can use Alexa is when the speaker isn't being used. Which then, I've more than likely got it turned of. Very disheartening as I really wanted to implement Alexa into my music, smart thermostat, etc. I'm really hoping this is just a bug and can/will be fixed in a sooner-than-later firmware update.As for sound, I found a lot of inconsistencies there as well. When playing music or other audio, I noticed I had to turn this speaker up louder than my BOOM to get the same level of volume out of it. I have to use my MEGABLAST at about half volume to get it at the same sound level as 1/3 volume of my BOOM. Which is weird because...isn't this supposed to be the loudest speaker they offer? It appears this speaker does better at mid to higher level volumes than lower to mid level. I initially thought that the ""max"" volume of the speaker was independant of the volume I have on my device because I could say ""Alexa, change the volume to 10"" and the volume bar on my device would stay the same, but the speaker would be much louder. But then...when I raise or lower the volume a notch on the device, the speaker volume would change to match that. Another issue I noticed...the speaker outputs the audio that is being played...but none of my other device sounds. Unlike my boom, I don't can't hear the keyboard typing sound, any text or e-mail notification sounds, etc. I've even turned the ""Sounds"" volume on my device up to the max with no results. But the audio being played is normal. I cannot figure this out to save my life.I didn't get to test the bluetooth phonecall quality during use because my BRAND NEW iPhone X that I've had for less than 15 days decided to bite the dust on me (the touch screen quit working...hardware defect) and I'm currently awaiting a replacement from my carrier.Conclusion:So, there you have it. So far, I have a love/hate relationship with this speaker. The volume inconsistencies are killing me and Alexa is all but useless since my bluetooth connection drops every time I use her. I also really with there was a battery level displayed on the device like my BOOM has, but the only way to see it with the MEGABOOM is via the app. These are my big 3 issues with the speaker and why I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. The only thing saving it from 3 stars is the amazing sound of the actual audio that is being played...as long as it's above half (5) on the volume level.Now, I did reach out to Logitech (the manufacturer of the Ultimate Ears brand) on Twitter earlier in the week. Several days have passed since then (which is why I waited a bit on my review) and I haven't heard anything back from them. I'll e-mail support about this I guess, when I get my phone back. But I really expected some sort of response or follow-up from them regarding this. Oh well. I should dock a star for this, but I won't.",Namdnas,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great,The sound is so loud instantly fell in love only down sides are the charger cable is verrrry unique so you must take care of it and battery life is a bit low b/c of internet & Bluetooth usage other than that it’s great,Anna,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great Audio but so so Alexa...,This thing had great sounding audio and great battery life. Setup was super easy and the firmware update was quick which is great. The big BUT is that the Alexa feature is hampered by a less sensitive microphone than that of the Echo Dot. The Dot microphone is just much more sensitive and works more reliably. There is also no standard 3.5 mm audio AUX jack. If you don;t care about the two flaws then this is a great but expensive device. If two flaws make you think twice then just get something else.,Michael,3

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Awesome speaker with voice command,"My family loves our new speaker that comes integrated with Alexa voice control. It has awesome sound with deep bass good for listening any type of music. It is very convenient that the speaker comes integrated with Alexa. Very easy to set up; just download Ultimate Ears app and follow instruction. During the setup, it suggested speaker software update which I did and found no issue. To use Alexa with the speaker, you need to use an Amazon account and Ultimate Ear offer free trial period for Amazon Music Unlimited. We did not encounter any issue giving Alexa commands even while playing loud music. The microphone works very well at detecting voice command. It is great that more and more devices are made waterproof and this device has this great feature. Hate seeing a good device getting damaged due to splashed water. I don’t plan to use this speaker near a pool but It will be placed on my kitchen’s island counter where water or liquid splash may accidentally occur. The Ultimate Ears website show an image that the speaker can even be used in the shower or the pool. You may even shower with Alexa playing your favorite songs.The speaker is a hard casing but with a coat of rubber-like material with will help in getting a strong grip on the device when transporting. The battery life is great and got the additional accessory for even easier charging. The power-up charging dock accessory is a great addition to get to complete for the speaker.To conclude, my entire house loves this new speaker and I would recommend it because of its awesome sound, this to any home.",SimpleLiving,5

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Great Travel Companion,"The Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Blutehooth Speaker is possibly all you need for a night at the pool, a session in the personal gym (That would be me.) even a Barbecue in the back yard or the patio. It has everything you need to carry your personal soundtrack any and everywhere (allowed). It's got a nice premium feel to it. it's wireless and water resistant. Plus, for the smart home savvy, there's Amazon Alexa integrated into the speaker. Okay, you've gotta admit, that's cool , right? The sound is crisp and clear, even at high volumes. It sounds really nice. Really nice. I guess the only thing I can say I wish this thing had, would be support for other streaming services. I use a different service other than Amazon music Unlimited usually. Then there's the whole pause when the phone rings. ( I'll live with that, since I'd normally have to scramble to find a remote on other occasions.) There are few options to stream, but I would just like more ( obviously. wouldn't we all? ) There are still a few things I have yet to learn, but it is definitely getting the job done. You should get one or two. Really.""The Ultimate Ears Power up"", sold separately, is also a great accessory to go with it, as it allows you to charge your speaker without laying it on it's side, all the while , keeping the party going. I have already recommended this speaker to a couple friends ( I don't waste time when I like stuff.) They come in few different colors. I got the black. It goes with everything. The price is really great for such a sweet piece of tech. Christmas is coming and I don't see why this wouldn't make it's way under a few trees. If not, just get one to blast that holiday spirit throughout the house. Basically, this would be a great addition to a smart home enthusiast or someone starting up their smart catalog. Even just for that person that likes cool gadgets.",hitsuyoo,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,"Excellent sound quality, inconsistent microphone","Compared to Amazon’s Echo, this speaker offers better sound quality. The midrange is very crisp and clear and makes vocals really stand out. When I listened to some of my Diana Krall playlist, her vocals sounded very intimate like she was singing right in front of me.Setup was very easy, you just plug it in and download and install the Ultimate Ears App for your phone/tablet and the app searches for and connects to the speaker after which you can set it up.To set up the speaker to connect to your wifi network, the app did require me to type in my wifi password which can be a pain on a phone/tablet if you have a long password. I’ve seen other apps that have the ability to automatically set up the password without the user having to type it in (after all the phone/tablet already knows the password if it is on your wifi network)My speakers came with a charging dock that is a must have accessory. It normally costs $39.99. Just sit your speaker on the charging dock and it will start charging. You don’t have to fumble around to flip the rubber tab hiding the usb port to charge the speaker.To set up your speaker to use the charging dock, you unscrew the original black plug on the bottom of the speaker and replace it with a shiny metallic plug that makes contact with the charging pins on the dock. I do wonder if the speaker is still as waterproof with the shiny metallic plug since water would be able to touch the charging rings on the plug.After you set up the speaker, you can use the standard Alexa app to fine tune the Alexa part of the speaker. One thing I noticed is that you can’t change the wake up word for the MegaBlast to anything else (Amazon, Computer etc.). It will only respond to Alexa. Also, some services like Spotify aren’t available yet but that didn’t bother me since I mostly use Amazon Music. So, basically, it seems like the MegaBlast doesn’t currently support all the features of the Amazon Echo. Hopefully, future firmware upgrades will fix this.The top of the speaker is slightly concave with a light bar that lights up when it recognizes a voice command. Compared to the Echo and Echo Dot, I found myself having to repeat myself a lot more before the MegaBlast would respond to my voice commands. Because of this, I don’t think it’s microphones are as good as those in the Echo. To make matters worse, it’s sometimes hard to know if it recognizes the wake up word because it can be difficult to see the light at the top of the speaker if the speaker is located at or above eye level.I had no problems using it as a bluetooth speaker. Pairing with my phone/tablets was easy and I always had a strong connection with no drop-outs.In summary, the MegaBlast is a stellar portable bluetooth speaker that offers superior sound quality over most competing bluetooth speakers. As an Alexa smart speaker, it falls a little short of a real Amazon Echo with regards to command recognition and it currently doesn’t support all the features of a real Amazon Echo. Hopefully future firmware upgrades will rectify some of these shortcomings.",DoctorHoo,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,So far so good,Like it. Wish I could get everything synced up. Tried the yoga but only got a bunch of static. Don’t know how to trouble shoot.,McMe,4
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Best speaker for everyone,"Easy Bluetooth connection, remember last device it was hooked up to if your like myself and have multiple Bluetooth devices. I've noticed my other devices tend to prioritize iOS over Android but this doesn't do that. Amazon Alexa is heavily integrated with the UE MegaBlast. If your a heavy user of Amazon services and product this is for you. If not as a Bluetooth speaker there's other options at this price point that will give you better physical controls, unless you prefer voice control for things like skip, previous track, volume. If you have smart home devices connected to Alexa you'll be able to control them thought this speaker. The only draw back I can find with this was the missing controls like the UE Mega Boom speaker. Touch controls are missing like placing your hand over the top to mute a song, tapping to skip a song. These sound allot better than the boom since this unit has bigger speakers than the other units. Water and dust proofing on all UE products are great, taken to parks, beaches, tailgating, pool parties I can say these speaker are 2 year old proof as well. Thrown in pools, buried under sand castle, tossed from slowly moving truck bed. While still looking new since the fabric used hasn't shown any wear or tear. Software is upgradeable, I foresee a long life with this speaker. Which brings me to battery life, 16 hours at mid level volume which is okay for this type of speaker. Overall I enjoy this speaker, being a heavily user of all things Amazon this is an easy integration of my Amazon ecosystem. Since voice control is getting better I prefer voice over tactile controls. The protections you get are better than most Bluetooth speaker on the market.",MikeElectronicBuff,4

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Must have speaker!,"I like the idea of smart speakers but I have held off from getting one until this speaker was released. The problem with other smart speakers is that they just don't have as great of a sound as I would like out of a speaker. The UE megaboom with Alexa is one of the best speakers I have used so far. The sound quality is rich and loud. Even at the highest volume the sound is good amount of base and sounds crisp. The battery life, build quality, and water proof capability of this speaker sets it above other speakers. One thing I like about this speaker is that you can use it as a regular speaker if you do not want to use Alexa. The charging dock for the speaker is a must have because it allows you to set the speaker on top of it to charge and it is simple. The only downside to this speaker has to do with Alexa. When Alexa is being used on the speaker anyone can say ""Alexa buy me...."" and it automatically purchases the item under the account owners card and mailing address. This isn't the end of the world but if anyone else has access to your speaker they can order stuff either on accident or to prank you.

The base is a little high but still the speakers sound very balanced. The app is an easy add on and complements the speaker well. Alexa was easy to setup and worked flawlessly. However just like any other alexa enabled speaker when the sound is loud it is difficult to get alexa to hear your commands. Our one year old is a big fan of alexa and really fascinated by our interaction.The charging base works flawlessly as well and the speaker runs about 7-8 hours on a single charge.This is an excellent alexa speaker from UE and delivers on all aspects.,leanwolf,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,One of the Best Bluetooth Speakers I've Tried,"Sporty, Loud, waterproof, and most importantly it has Amazon Alexa. This Bluetooth speaker has far been my favorite on the go speaker, I've owned several Bluetooth speakers, and this has far been my favorite sound wise and looks wise. I got the black option. It's discreet and simple just like a speaker should be. It's larger than your average Bluetooth speakers (Height: 9.3 inches, Width: 3.5, and Weights about 3 pounds).To use Amazon's Alexa, you will need to download the “Ultimate Ears” app and sign on with your amazon prime account (if applicable), you will also connect to your WIFI with this app other than that it’s a basic app with minimal features. Nothing stands out in this app. To really customize your Alexa experience, you will also need to download the Amazon Alexa app once again log in with your amazon prime account, you can enroll to other music services (Spotify – Must have Premium, Pandora – Basic Account okay, Tune In – No acct needed, and Iheartradio) so you can command Alexa to play these music apps by voice command.The sound coming out of this Bluetooth speaker is great! It’s loud, loud enough for my 1-bedroom apartment. The highs are nice, but when playing it loud the lows drown out a little bit, it’s not really on the bass heavy side but that doesn’t take away from the clear sound this speaker has. It didn’t bother me at all. It really sounds great! I also recommend that you also include the Charging Dock with the speaker, it’s roughly 40 dollars and it’s well worth it! It’s make the charging effortless, you just place the speaker on top of the dock and automatically starts charging. I placed the charging dock next to my bed so when I wake up I just turn it on, command Alexa to play my favorite music apps or tune in (talk shows), ask what’s the traffic time to work is, and turn it off when I leave to work. I like that the company includes a 2-year warranty, better than the average 1-year warranty. The battery life is 16 hours which is more than enough for your music needs. I haven’t tried the water-resistant feature, but it states it can be immersed in “liquid” up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. Overall, I really like this speaker, and all speakers should be like this product moving forward. It’s really a great Bluetooth speaker and I normally don’t like paying North of 200 dollars for a speaker, but this speaker is worth it and recommend to anyone!!",Mark,5

I've now replaced the Dot and speaker combo in the kitchen with the MegaBlast and it's perfect!Here are some features I really like:o I keep it sitting on the charging disk so it's powered on and ready to move if I want to take it with me while washing cars or working in the yard.o It's waterproof so I don't have to worry about splashing it in the kitchen or yard.o It says the battery will last 16 hours which is way longer than I want to be doing yard work.o The sound quality is fantastic. It's really clear even at high volume with no distortion that I can detect. It never sounded ""muddy"" or ""tinny"" like some speakers.o A nice perk is that it comes with 3 months of free Amazon Music Unlimited. I have Prime, but there are occasionally songs I've wanted that are only in the Unlimited service. It'll be nice to try it out and see how much I use it.There is really only one slight negative with the speaker that I found. The indicator light on top is recessed, and this is the light that lets you know if Alexa is listening to you. If you're across the room, sometimes you don't have a high enough angle to see the light and I found that annoying. I guess I really did get used to watching the light ring on the Echo Dot so I miss being able to see that across the room. However, I think the quality speaker sound more than makes up for that loss. It's great to have Alexa in a portable, waterproof, quality speaker.",FlyingC,5

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Awesome audio......so-so functionality,"Hands down, this is the best bluetooth speaker I've heard. Since everyone's listening tastes differ, you mileage may vary. There's more than enough bass (tight and slightly ""punchy"" that you can feel) and the mids/highs are more pronounced and crisp. And, with any speaker, the quality that goes in is reflected in the quality that comes out. So, your Spotify extreme downloads will sound better than the music ripped from Napster in 2002. There's more than enough headroom to overwhelm a small (12x12) room but a large room wouldn't be a problem, either. As it's winter in my locale, I haven't tested outdoor results but fidelity will obviously be lost, as is the case with any speaker, absent any reflective surfaces.Yeah, it's a fairly large speaker but I'd have no problem putting it into a carry-on to accompany me on a vacation. Solid build and finish.I put this up against BB's standard aisle fare and it really stood out for me with its superior sound. I walked into the store expecting to buy the large Bose Revolve+ but didn't like its sound characteristics nearly enough. That may be the right speaker for you so take the opportunity to do an in-store listen before purchasing. The other UE offerings just didn't have the clarity and sound I wanted although others can be paired up for stereo sound which would make a difference. In the end, I just wanted one speaker and this was it.And, if you want a decent carry case, search Amazon for telephoto camera lens bags. I think mine (JJC) was about $12 and carries the charge cable and wall wart with the speaker with ease. What can be improved:Wi-fi connectivity is spotty. For whatever reason it stopped connecting to my primary wi-fi network but has no problem with the guest one. Go figure.The microphones aren't nearly as sensitive as my Alexa devices. In fact, I have to raise my voice enough that other devices pick up the requests, too.Bluetooth doesn't autoconnect in the app. It's just a couple clicks but I can be listening to music, open the app, and it won't find the speaker until I select it in the menu. Dumb.The recharge port is kinda' in a dumb place, on the bottom, protected by a threaded cover. Makes sense for durability but I'm sure more than one owner will lose his/her cover or threaded bolt.UE could stand to add an EQ setting in the app but I'm running EQ Pro on my Android and that launches automatically so NBD. Still, it would be nice if a speaker manufacturer had the forethought to allow customizing its products' sound without going third-party. Again, just a nit but I like messing with the sound.Good luck with your search and happy listening!",JRausta,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Does not work.,"When I got this it had a attached cover letter to help you get started. Didn't work for me. First, I could not find the Android App in the Play Store. There were other similar Apps but none of them looked like they were applicable. And their reviews were not very good. So I went to my Apple iPad and found a App there. During the setup the speaker itself needed to be set up on my WiFi. I did that and then it failed several times to connect to a update server. I have a limited WiFi connection and this chewed up about 300 Megs and still not a peep out of the speaker. I think this device is way too complicated for the average user.",nuismer,1
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Audiophile's Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant,"Ultimate Ears - MEGABLAST is a stunning portable speaker with Alexa built-in. I own several Voice-Controlled Personal Assistants, so I am very familiar with Alexa's capabilities & will compare UE MEGABLAST accordingly.LIKES: 1- Bass output is second to no other device with Alexa onboard. Nothing is even close. Put your hand near the side when it is rocking & feel the air from the woofers & passive radiators! Bass sounds like a quality 8"" woofer! 2- High frequencies are crystal clear, noticeably more musical than the average Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant, which is an impressive accomplishment.3- Waterproof to 1 meter for 30 minutes.4- Long lasting built-in rechargeable Li-ion battery rocks out up to 16 hours between charges!5- Built-in equalization emulates ""Loudness On"". Bass is always leading & high frequencies are above the midrange. The equalization has been finely tuned & is not adjustable.6- Bluetooth Input permits sound from any Bluetooth source. This is exceptionally handy in areas with no Wi-Fi.7- Very rugged case is perfect for portable use.8- Syncs with other Alexa equipped devices; they all answer questions, play the news, announce sports, weather, route time to work & other traditional Alexa functions.9- Automatic updates arrive via Wi-Fi to improve performance over time. 10- Uses the tried-and-true Alexa app.11- Voice command most smart home devices.12- 360 degree sound is much more obvious than in the average Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant, due to the multiple premium quality tweeters & the sound has a spread matrix stereo effect. It really sounds like there are 2 speakers in the room. In addition to the more forward bass & articulate highs, this spread stereo sound is stunning.13- The charging base (optional & sold separately) makes charging as simple as sitting the speaker on a round disk. Highly recommended!14- Auto off after a period of time when the music has stopped to save the battery. Or with the Charging Base, it converts to always on, always listening for ""Alexa"" command. 15- Plays extremely loud! 93dB rated output!16- No audible distortion in the bass, even at high SPL's!17- The light on the top shows status / battery / Alexa command following & many more items. 18- Very easy to set-up with both Ultimate Ears & Alexa Apps. 19- Works great with Amazon Prime Music - simply name a song, or ask to stream music by your favorite artist.20- Expert, reliable control of HUE Lights & many Home Automation Devices.21- Most beautiful packaging of any consumer productI have ever seen.22- Standard 1/4""-20 tripod thread on the bottom makes for flexible placement.CONCERNS: 1- ""Alexa Lite"" best describes the reduced capability of the personal assistant. Having numerous Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant devices already, the differences jumped out: No Sirius XM, Spotify or Pandora Streaming; no ""Amazon"" wake-up name option (only Alexa); no voice confirmation when you call out ""Alexa"", though the light on top indicates Alexa has been queried, if you happen to look in that direction. 2- Equalization (bass / midrange / treble balance) is not user adjustable, though it comes factory set to produce amazing sound.3- No 3.5mm audio input jack to hardwire sound from an external device to maintain clear audio. Bluetooth is a limited fidelity transmission, and this speaker is so good, that really shows. Streaming sound from Prime Music, for example, sounds stunning; streaming from your phone or tablet by Bluetooth lacks the dynamic range, bass punch & high frequency clarity and sounds just ""O.K.""4- Pairing 2) MEGABLAST speakers for Right / Left stereo sound is not possible as of this test. However, this feature may appear via a future automatic Software update. CONCLUSION: If you are an audiophile, BUY MEGABLAST!! You will not believe your ears if you stream music from Amazon Prime or other high quality streaming sources. Avoid Bluetooth for audio purity reasons. Sound quality vs. cost make this device an absolute STEAL for audiophiles!!However, if you prioritize the maximum capability of the Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant over sound quality, then other, less costly devices may better meet your expectations.MEGABLAST far exceeded my expectations & earned my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!",gadgetguy11,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Wanted to like this...,To start off sound is super objective to the individual listening so I'm not saying I'm a sound aficionado just going to tell you how it sounds to me. First thing that you need to talk about with this unit is the unboxing experience. The manufacturer made it a fun experience with a quality feeling EVERYTHING! Once you get past that you see all its features and I was excited. I booted mine while it was on it's wireless charger to find my first pro and con. Alexa is great if you have amazon music which to be fair Logitech gives you a trail of it to get you started. I don't listen to my music from Amazon and didn't like that I was forced into because my music service was not supported. Asking basic things like paus stop or next track are fun but I noticed that when I used the Alexa side it disconnected the Bluetooth side... every... single... time. So I stopped using it for that and just focused on sound quality. Unfortunately this was a tall order on this unit. I felt the sound had a incredible amount of treble which hurt me even at 50% volume. My phone luckily supports a great equalizer built in and I tweaked it to sound good but not great. For how much you invest in a unit like this I felt like they fell short. It has a lot of things to love like the basic waterproofing it offers and wireless charging to make everything super simple but to me those are cool/gimmicky. To summarize if water proof speaker is what your looking for with wireless charging then I would say this is probably the best one. If your looking for the best sound you can get I would say maybe something else.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helped a little in your decision. Good Luck!,AverageConsumer,3

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Sweet sounding speaker that's smart too!,"This speaker is very impressive!! Probably the key thing to know is that the sound is of great quality and it's loud just like the first generation and I'd say this one tops that! It's almost hard to believe you can get that kind of sound out of a small portable speaker but you do with this one. Coupled with it you have Amazon's Alexa built in so it makes it versatile on top of just having great sound - a huge advantage over other speakers. It has the ability to connect via WiFi so you can stream audio directly to the speaker and can use Alexa to control it. With Alexa of course, you can do a lot of different things like controlling smart devices such as lights or appliances or simply use it to control audio, get news updates, etc. If you can't connect to WiFi or have it out and about you can connect directly to your phone or tablet to stream your audio directly to the speaker. The design is solid and simple. All in all, I'd very much recommend this speaker if you're looking for a good high quality speaker that is flexible and can be used both at home on the dock and on the go. Pros:Loud high quality sound and bass (quite impressive for it's size!!)Great battery lifeWiFi and Bluetooth ConnectivityOptional charging base makes it easy to chargeMicro USB ChargingExternal controls and can also be voice controlled with AlexaCons:None so far!",btb2k,5
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good speaker but doesn’t have all the functionality that the Megaboom had. For example, ability to pair up other UE speakers, control volume from the app, etc. I’m sure all those features plus much more will be avaialable with coming updates.",BaldEagle,3
Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,"Good, but Missing some Well Loved Features","The UE Megablast is the newest arrival to the UE lineup to offer fantastically crisp and clear audio with strong bass response, with the new addition being the Amazon Alexa voice assistant. With a sleek cylindrical design, waterproofing that allows the speaker to be submersible, and omnidirectional speaker output, the UE Megablast aims to be the only speaker that you need in the home, at the pool, at the party, and everywhere in between. What’s In the Box?-A box with a lot of funky and groovy art (you’ll know what I mean when you slide off the tame looking cover)-UE Megablast speaker-Quick Start Guide-Micro USB cable-USB ChargerAppearance and Build Quality: The all cylindrical design looks very similar to an oversize beer can with a rugged, rubberized exterior shell to handle all the scrapes, bruising, and drops that will occur over its lifetime. The speaker is covered in a hard, fabric-like grill to allow the audio to pass through the two 25mm tweeters, two 55mm drivers, and two 85mm x 50mm passive radiators, all the while keeping dust, moisture, and water from seeping into the interior. On the bottom of the speaker is a circular rubber cover protecting the micro usb port for charging. There is also a removable D-ring underneath the speaker. I assume this D-ring is for hanging the speaker. Up top is the power button and another much smaller button to enable Bluetooth pairing. The very oversized +/- buttons are located along the sides of the cylinder. The button labels for + and – are huge, you’d have to be blind not to notice them. And maybe it is just me, but they do have the visual appearance of resembling a religious cross. Features:+Rugged Design – Take the speaker anywhere indoors and outdoors, but of course don’t subject it to extreme heat or cold. +Omnidirectional sound+Up to 16 hrs battery life – more than enough for a full day of partying assuming you get 8 hrs of sleep to round out a 24 hr day. It will take up to 3 hrs to recharge a fully discharged battery. +IP67 rating – This means this speaker goes beyond simply being cowardly splash proof, but boldly insists on being dunked under water in approximately 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. I was too afraid to put this to the test, since I did not want to ruin a $300 speaker. I’ll take UE at their word.+Strong Bluetooth connection. I didn’t experience any Bluetooth stuttering or disconnections. In fact, UE boasts that the Bluetooth range is up to 150 feet. +Wifi music streaming from IHeartRadio, Amazon Prime Music, and TuneIn Radio through Amazon Alexa. Pandora and Deezer are purportedly to be included in the future. +Integrated Amazon Alexa voice assistant. This may or may not be important to you depending on whether or not you are already subscribed to one of the two dominant voice assistant ecosystems (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) presently available in the market. Features that are Missing: Equally important to the features (aka “the selling points”) are the features that are missing in the UE Megablast which are offered by some of the competitors in the portable Bluetooth speaker market.-No NFC connection. -No 3.5mm audio jack. I am disappointed, but not surprised. Would have been great if UE included a 3.5mm jack since wired audio quality is still better than Bluetooth transmission audio quality. -You cannot connect two or more UE Megablasts together or to other speakers in the UE lineup via Bluetooth in a party mode to have multiple speakers playing the same music simultaneously. Not sure why UE took this feature off the table. Just imagine how loud your party could get if you could connect them together! Audio Quality: I was impressed by the audio output of the speakers. The omnidirectional (aka 360 degree) sound meant that there are no fading, audio dead spots as I moved about my room. The UE Megablast can get really loud to the point that your neighbors will be knocking on your door to turn it down. The mid-range representing vocals and speech is very crisp and clear. The highs are equally well represented. Bass kicks in strong without overpowering the high and midrange frequencies. This means that when you’re listening to music with strong bass, you can still clearly hear the vocals. And if you choose to watch a movie using the UE Megablast, you can clearly hear the bass response from action sequences, but wouldn’t have to adjust equalizers to hear dialogue. Amazon Alexa Voice Assistant: I’m not going to go too much into this. You are initially asked to connect to Amazon Alexa when you first set up the speaker through the Ultimate Ears app available through the Google Play Store or Apple App store. The microphone does a fine job of picking up audio across my room and I’m able to ask Alexa questions and give it commands. Alexa will only work if the speaker is connected through the wifi network. It will not work on a Bluetooth only connection.If you find yourself desiring some privacy, you have two options to turn off the microphone from listening to your conversation. First method is to open the Ultimate Ears app, tap on the microphone icon, and tap ‘off’ to disable the microphones. A tone will be emitted and a small red light will illuminate at the top of the speaker to indicate that the microphones have been turned off. The second method is to use the speaker controls. On the speaker, press the volume down ‘ – ‘ and the Bluetooth button simultaneously. You will hear a tone and see the red light at the top of the speaker. This indicates that the microphone has been turned off. To turn them back on, press the same buttons again. Finally, one thing to take note. UE did a poor job with the location for the micro usb charging port. The port is located at the bottom base of the speaker. That means when you are charging it, you will have to place the speaker on its side horizontally, which means it has a strong chance of rolling off your table. Or you can place the speaker upside down, with the power button on the bottom. The only other alternative is to purchase the charging dock which will allow you to charge the speaker in the upright position. Conclusion: Do I recommend the UE Megablast? Given its very good audio quality and sleek, rugged build quality, I totally believe it is a sound choice (pun intended) and should be on your short list. However, given that some of the features are noticeably missing which were found in the previous UE lineup (eg. Megaboom) at a lower price point, you will need to really ask yourself if the addition of the Alexa assistant is worth the tradeoff.",lambda100,4

Ultimate Ears,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,tons of volume in a relatively small package,"the good:- sound quality - tons of volume and clarity, and even at high (and i do mean *high* - this little guy pumps out the sound!) volumes very little if any distortion. good spectrum top to bottom, nothing overly forward or distracting. just punchy and fun to listen to.- alexa/wifi integration - the alexa integration may or may not be useful to all. if it is, having a portable speaker of this quality will certainly be a major plus. with an amazon prime music account, you don’t even need another device to play music - “alexa play foo fighters” brought up a nice shuffled mix of foo with nothing else attached to the speaker, even via bluetooth. pretty cool.- design - attractive “360” design, rugged and waterproof-battery life - rated at 16 hours at mid volume, and appears to be accurate.the bad:- pairing issues using my mac - pairing to my iphone was easy and quick, but for some reason pairing to my macbook pro had issues. i was never quite able to just use it as a bluetooth speaker with the laptop as i was with the phone.- can’t keep continuously plugged in w/o the accessory charger - to me it’s a bit of a design flaw, probably necessary to keep the unit water tight, but in any case, the micro usb port is on the bottom of the speaker, meaning you can’t exactly keep it plugged in and charging unless you pay for the accessory charger dock ($40). would’ve been nice to have this ability without the extra cost.overall:i would really like to give this speaker 4.5 stars, but since we are limited in our 5 star review system to only using full stars, i’ll round up and give it 5 stars. the sound quality alone at least justifies that much. just a couple minor issues short of a full 5 stars in my opinion, but highly recommended none the less.",bd43274,5

If you are already familiar with Amazon Alexa, this is no different. It can do all of the regular voice commands that a regular Alexa product can do. It is more limited in that you can't do drop in, calling, or multiroom audio.With that being said this speaker sounds great. I compared it to the Megaboom and the highs are a lot cleaner.

Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Great Gift,I got this for my girlfriend because she is about to go on a trip to Africa.

I was even reluctant to buy a backpack due to the thought of having to strap it on, but I find I carry it in my hand by the straps anyway.

Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Met My Needs,"Am a 68-year-old amateur. On my first trip to Europe, I used a shoulder bag. It held my Vixia G40, 5DMk3, 24-105, 17-40, 530EXii, a small accessories assortment but No tripod. For a man in average physical shape, that turned out to be a burden and a strain on each shoulder. So much so that I would periodically pass it to a younger person until I was well enough to resume carrying it. Carrying a shoulder bag also caused me an imbalance when walking for long distances. For this years trip, a backpack type bag was on my mind. At the store, I tried on about 8 products on the shelves before picking the last Lowepro Flipside 300. It looked the right size to qualify as a carry on bag, it could fit my gear mentioned above, a tripod could be strapped to it, it felt strong, the top side has this enormous handle to pick up the bag with, there were enough Velcro partitions for any storage configuration, the shoulder straps were wide and comfy, it holds a water bottle, it fit anywhere I went without it being in the way, and it just plain made me look good wearing it. My collapsible Sirui T-025X tripod was a little short, but extending it a bit helped getting the bags tripod-holding strap around it. The whole thing was smaller if not the same size as what most other people on the flight had. The Lowepro Flipside 300 met my needs this trip. It held all my gear. I did not tire wearing it. It was easy to access its interior. I am happy I selected it. By now, I will assume that Lowepro has updated it or has designed something better in the 300 series. Lowepro thinks out well how to design their equipment. They were definitely thinking of me.",Lupe T,5
Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Best camera backpack I've ever purchased,"The Flipside 300 is my go-to backpack for event photography and for urban exploring.

I've bought two of these and hope they never discontinue. Highly recommended!",DezM,5

I have been traveling with this backpack and I can almost say that it is a PERFECT backpack.",Joo Gregrio,5
Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Owned for just over two years,"I purchased this in 2015 and I still use it on every adventure trip, professional shoot, and personal camera experience I go on. I love the design and the shape as well as the weight. I thankfully have had no issues with the zippers but am just starting to see wear on the seam that attaches the bottom and the part closest to my back. I tend to get into rough terrain and treat my pack roughly (although not SUPER roughly as I obviously have camera gear in it) so I'm happy it has lasted this long. Depending on lens size, I can fit a DSLR, a mirrorless body, 5 or 6 lenses and a lens adapter plus cards, batteries, and chargers. The size is great and allows me to carry a TON but not overload myself entirely. I also love the carry handle on the top. So handy! I would like to see a separate piece that attaches to the top of the bag to help keep a tripod steady.. if you're not carrying a tiny one, the top of the tripod will pull its weight away from your back and tends to sway around. I've found ways to tie it but it would be a huge improvement if it was already attached. Highly recommend although I'd like to see the previously mentioned tripod support and a reinforced bottom.",Lizz,4
Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Almost fantastic,"I've owned and used this bag for a year now. It's become my primary bag only when I bring my 70-200mm. Which is also the reason I purchased this back. It's well made, comfortable and fits more everything I need. So why is it only ALMOST fantastic. First, the side pocket size only zips upward. Been a number of occasions where I've found myself is wet weather. Thus, with the zipper zipping upward only, water has got into the pocket. Secondly, the ONLY way to get to the camera is to take off the bag and opening the entire backpack. It sure would be nice to have a zipper on the top of the bag so you could quickly access your camera. Don't know if there is a perfect bag. If there is, I haven't found it. For now, this will do.",Penguin,4
Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Perfect for hiking,"I used this everywhere I went for 2 years and loved it! (eventually upgraded to a larger Flipside as I got more gear) Pros: I could swing it around, open it with full access to everything, and it acted like a portable table if I needed to change lenses or clean something! Very sturdy and well built. Good cushioning and compartmentalizing on the inside. Liked the small zip pouch on the inside too keep all my smaller stuff. Cons: Very small side pouch - only useful for a phone, keys, extra card. I ended up making my own belt padding for longer hikes - would be nice if it had something already.",cowleywag,5

I can fit my Canon 80D with 100-400 mm lens attached and have room for other lens too. I love the removable pouch which gives you versatility if needed. Surprisely, my tripod also fits perfectly.

Although a little tight I can put my camera with battery grip and a 150-600mm lens in it. I have found the flipside 300 to be well built. The materials and workmanship is second to none.

The 500 is hard to miss, where the 300 blends and when I am doing street work, I want that. Being able to quickly swing it around, open, swop lenses . . . Works Great!

Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Just what I was looking for.,"I'm a landscape photographer and recreational hiker and was looking for something that would carry my gear comfortably and conveniently and this fits the bill perfectly​. It easily carries my 5D, filters, accessories, and more then I need in the field, but it's all there. The flip around access to the storage area is nice, but I did have some trouble with the straps coming undone. This was easily fixed once I made final adjustments and secured the straps better.The extra padding on the lower back is nice and the tripod holder is convenient too. This was the right size for my needs and with several months of use and many miles of hiking the woods, I'm very happy with the purchase.",KenM,5

This bag is the 3rd Lowepro bag I've owned over the last 4 years (All upgrades).I'll just get my details out of the way.

I ordered this to have something small and easy to carry on my trips out of state that I could carry on to the plane with me and still have a good compliment of equipment without lugging everything along..Pros: Very well built bag, like I had mentioned earlier, this is my 3rd Lowepro bag.. I've never been let down by the quality and this bag does not disappoint. Security is top of the line as well on this bag with the opening back panel. The bag holds a variety of equipment while maintaining the this ain't a camera bag look..Cons:There were a few things that I didn't like about this bag... they are listed below. The sliplock system mounting straps are very poorly located on the shoulder straps. If one were to use these sliplocks, with lens cases like the 1N and 1W, they would find that the cases sit right on the tops of your shoulders if ya carry the bag cinched down, or over the shoulder if ya wear the bag lower on your back with the shoulder straps extended.

Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Nice pack 58 of 60 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"I'm very satisfied with the purchase of this pack. I don't have a lot of equipment or glass, but the small top-loader I had was not cutting it any more. I was looking for a relatively small pack to store a few lenses, flash, chargers, and of course the camera. I tried to like the Lowepro Slingshot, but ultimately wasn't satisfied with the side load design. It's a great concept and I know that it's great for getting those quick shots, but I was concerned with its ability to accommodate a long lens attached to the camera. This bag is supposedly designed to allow you to leave the straps that buckle across your hips connected so you can swing it around and open the pack while standing. I haven't tested this and really have no intention of using it in this fashion, so I can't give an opinion. It was not a factor in my decision, but it may be in yours. Here are the pros and cons in my opinion.Pros- Decent storage for anyone with a light inventory- Typical adjustable configuration using Velcro dividers- Security of having the zippers against your back- Clean designCons- Not much storage room for other items- The zipper can be a bit awkward since they are partially hidden- Not All Weather, but they may come out with that versionI like the idea of having the zippers against your back for two reasons. The first is security. I really don't have to worry much about anyone trying to gain access to my bag in a crowd. Also, if you're like me I constantly worry about my gear falling out because the zipper was not closed all the way. I've had some bad experiences with standard backpacks that did this when the zipper was not FULLY closed. It wasn't even that I forgot to zip it.Read more",EFis,5

Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),The Honeymoon's over,"First of all, this is a great product and does what it is supposed to. But if falls short of true greatness in several areas. I know secure packing is a priority, but none of my issues would affect the protection of the equipment except for clipped on components. I wanted a case like this (I have many others as well) and the security and form factor are what I needed. But this is a photography bag and thus should be designed for photography, not permanent storage.First, as anyone knows whose shooting action whether sports, news or animals, being able to open a bag while juggling lenses, bodies, etc. speed is of the essence. The problem here is not access, but the size and reach of the zippers. The zipper teeth are on the small size and I fear as the zippers go screaming around the corners, their life will be short, especially since they hang up rounding the top corners. They have not jammed or broken yet, but these are zippers are only human. I think a pair of 10 YKKs are in order instead of wimpy small teeth zips with big pulls.My second gripe is with the reach of the zippers. I carry an 80-200 2.8 across the bottom of the pack (it allows me several lens/body choices so I can carry any lens on my D300 with MB-D10 grip (upsidedown from the usual pictures, by the way). The zippers don't quite reach the bottom of the pack so I have to wedge the lens out at unrealistic effort. In fact, much of the diameter of the lens falls below the reach of the zippers. I'm sure there's some reason for this design, but whatever it is escapes me.Oh, I use the small dividers in a way that can flip them sideways or down when not needed and close like a door when needed.Read more",Tripwire,5

Lowepro,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),Good Bang for the Buck,"I have found this bag fits most of my field photography needs. The particular attraction was the ability to hold my Canon 450D with Sigma 150-500 attached, room for a 24-70 lens, 430 flash, and the miscellaneous camera gear that goes with me. I bought this item locally rather than via Amazon as camera bags are one of those items (I think) you should not buy sight unseen. Camera bags have to be tested and decided by the user personally - user needs are unique as the bags.I demanded several criteria in a camera bag:1. No more than 100 cost (it's a padded BAG!)2. Capacity for 450D body, battery grip, 150-500 lens attached, short lens (24-70), miscellaneous smaller gear3. Comfortable (naturally)4. Overall bag size should not be larger than a student's book bag.Optional preferences:A. Tether for monopod/tripodB. Preferably a sling bag to access equipment without having to take off the packC. Theft resistantD. Room for a water bottle, umbrella, keys, and other personal items.I tried and considered several items including the Tenba Shootout Medium Sling Bag, Lowepro Slingshot 100/200 (300 is hard to find in stock locally), Lowepro Fastpack 200, Canon 200EG. Surprisingly, all of these bags are too small to handle a 500mm w/ body attached. I also have a military fabric messenger bag I used prior to the 150-500 (custom added padding, dividers) but that became obsolete with the new lens. All of these bags had great features and would have worked wonderfully - if you don't have a large 400mm+ lens w/ body attached.I effectively had to forget about the side loading sling bags - they can hold a larger lens by itself but not with the camera body.Read more",The Squirrel,5

I previously previously brought PNY memory from a different store. Put Both memory modules in my MacBook (mid 2010), the computer did not boot up. After several tests including putting the original memory back in, it was clear that PNY memory modules were defective. After returning them to the store and getting my money back. I decided to try out the Corsair Memory as it was recommended by a friend. I after looking at several other sites for this memory I ended up getting it from Wallmart.com using the site to store option. (Unsurprisingly Walmart had the best price.)

"Sdi Technologies, Inc.",iHome Rechargeable Splash Proof Stereo Bluetooth Speaker - Black (IBT33BC),"Nice Speaker, But...","I purchased this speaker as a Christmas gift for my fianc. If you are looking for a small speaker to use, it meets that criteria. The speaker is reasonably priced. There is no pouch or carrying case that comes with the speaker. The speaker produces a nice sound. It is not an ""high-end"" Bluetooth speaker, but it delivers a welcomed punch. The challenge with this speaker is that it may not connect with all devices, at least this is what I experienced. I had a couple of MP3 players that it did not connect with. My fiances phone (Samsung Note 5) would pair, but would drop frequently. I did get it to pair with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet. So, there may be some pairing issues with some devices. However, if you are able to get it to pair, you will enjoy the sound. I will keep the speaker since it works with my tablet, but, I will search for another one that pairs more easily with various devices. If you decide to buy, just be mindful that it may or may not pair or pair smoothly with your device or devices",Blozero,3

"Sdi Technologies, Inc.",iHome Rechargeable Splash Proof Stereo Bluetooth Speaker - Black (IBT33BC),"Nice Speaker, But...","I purchased this speaker as a Christmas gift for my fiancé. If you are looking for a small speaker to use, it meets that criteria. The speaker is reasonably priced. There is no pouch or carrying case that comes with the speaker. The speaker produces a nice sound. It is not an ""high-end"" Bluetooth speaker, but it delivers a welcomed punch. The challenge with this speaker is that it may not connect with all devices, at least this is what I experienced. I had a couple of MP3 players that it did not connect with. My fiance’s phone (Samsung Note 5) would pair, but would drop frequently. I did get it to pair with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet. So, there may be some pairing issues with some devices. However, if you are able to get it to pair, you will enjoy the sound. I will keep the speaker since it works with my tablet, but, I will search for another one that pairs more easily with various devices. If you decide to buy, just be mindful that it may or may not pair or pair smoothly with your device or devices",Blozero,3

I'm now averaging around 110GB of Data usage per month, having said that if you don't know this is going to use a lot of data you're just plain dumb. The XLTE network is fast, compared this to my 4620 and it went from a 18Mb/s down and a 10 Mb/s up speed to 30 Mb/s down and 15 Mb/s up, if you're in a great area you can even hit 50 down and 20 up.

Verizon Wireless,Verizon MiFi 6620L Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot (Verizon Wireless),Finally a good hotspot,"Faster than the previous-generation hotspot, and gets better LTE signal.

I'll update this review if I experience any problems that other users are reporting (starting off at fast speeds, then slowing down, etc.). I think those issues mainly depend on your coverage, and you can sometimes help it by getting an external antenna and/or signal amplifier if you are in an area with poor coverage (see below). Since this review is about this device and not Verizon coverage (though if it were, I would also say that they do have one of the larger LTE networks), I'm rating it based on the device itself. Allow me to explain some pros/cons:PROS:* Uses Verizon's XLTE bands, making it essentially capable of faster speeds (higher bandwidth on less crowded spectrum) if you live in an area with that coverage (again, not rating the coverage, just the fact that this device has this capability).*Many sources online indicate this also is LTE Advanced capable, so this should keep the device current moving forward for some time.* The device doubles as a battery pack! This would be useful for me, say at a conference or event where I sometimes had to bring another battery pack for a mobile device.* Fully customizable router-like features.

I had trouble with the clock showing up on the display but its been up the last few days with no time lost.

JVC,JVC KD-X320BTS Apple iPod and Android Digital Media Receiver with Bluetooth,Good radio for the price,"Good midrange radio. I needed Bluetooth in my car, and this definitely filled the need. Android compatible. I haven't tried apps for the phone yet, since I can control my media player via bluetooth already. Radio works fine, the bluetooth calling works fine. Overall a great Single DIM feature filled radio if you don't need a CD player or GPS. If I had to give it a con, I would say a case for the removable cover would've been nice, but that's just me being picky. Also read the instrucitions, the ""Pause/Play"" button is actually labeled as something else for Bluetooth. You may also need to boost the volume for bluetooth specifically, there is a way to do this in the settings. Just spend like 10-15 minutes in your car going through the instructions and playing with the settings.",HakeemEwing,5

Worked with my Android Note3 with little problem.The sub outs will be perfect for the addition of a powered Bass speaker in the future.I use the AUX in to pump the sound from the TV into the RV system. The antenna on the RV sucks, but the unit was still able to pull in enough stations through that antenna, at the various camp sites, to keep us happy.For the price, can't be beat.",Bob3,5

First thing I noticed was it noticeable improved the audio quality over the oem receiver. Bluetooth and usb performance are flawless. It supports Siri eyes free on my iPhone.

First, from what my friends tell me, they can't even tell I'm driving (and my car is LOUD), so the bluetooth/cell call feature is fantastic. Music plays great, good volume with nothing added. Easy installation with a cheap kit off the web, just need a soldering iron and electrical tape.

I love that I can plug in my iPod classic to the USB, and use the receiver's controls for it. Very handy when driving.

JVC,JVC KD-X320BTS Apple iPod and Android Digital Media Receiver with Bluetooth,Good to go,"Got this to upgrade from my old JVC X50BT. They did fix a few issues I had with that one, like losing the Bluetooth signal occasionally and showing PAUSE on the display all the time when using Bluetooth. This one is much smoother, connects to Bluetooth immediately, reads USB immediately - both very slow on the old one. However on this one, you're stuck with blue buttons - one of which is way too bright at night even on the dimmest setting. I blacked that one out with a Sharpie as you can see in the photo. And the main display is still too dim to see during the day on the brightest setting. It's not as deep as a normal head unit since it doesn't have a CD player. The settings may be confusing for new JVC owners, but I'm used to it by now. All JVCs are pretty much the same. Picked it up at Best Buy for 90.",burns1210,

Fast connect to bluetooth, crisp sound when using cellphone, Brought Life to old speakers.User interface is more fluid than my past JVC purchases. Though shallow and light sound quality is clear for me. Display lighting is dim even on the highest setting on sunny days. Material used is lacking, in my opinion than my previous JVC Units.

JVC,JVC KD-X320BTS Apple iPod and Android Digital Media Receiver with Bluetooth,Inexpensive Bluetooth Integration,"The factory head unit in my car was just basic AM/FM/CD. I purchased this to get Bluetooth hands-free and media playback via my phone. I've purchased 3 different Bluetooth add-on adapters to try to add Bluetooth to my factory radio, but they all failed after a few months and had issues with ground loop noise, or pairing problems, etc. This unit costs as much as I spent on just two of the Bluetooth adapters I tried, and it has many more features and doesn't have a bunch of extra wires hanging around. Of course, installation took a couple hours instead of a couple minutes. I'm satisfied as this unit works well for what I needed. Pandora and iHeartRadio support are a small bonus.Pros: Inexpensive. Bluetooth hands-free. Pandora/iHeartRadio. The unit is not very deep so it's easy to install without worrying about not having room for wires and adapters. Ditches the 30-year-old CD player technology I haven't used in 5 years.Cons: No integrated microphone (external mic is included). Overly flashy aftermarket look. The menus are a non-intuitive to navigate and buttons not well marked. This is a problem with nearly all aftermarket head units, though. It came with demo mode enabled which makes the display constantly flash with pseudo graphics that are really distracting. Thankfully, I figured out how to turn it off in the menus. Pairs with 5 different devices, but selecting one or the other is about the same amount of effort as pairing a new device.",Brianosaurus,

No driliing, cutting or any modifications necessary. And for the price, you won't find a better speaker if you are looking for true sound reproduction.

The original adapter I believe was rated somewhere between 65-85 Watts, this one is only 45.

This makes the cord that comes with it a little bulkier than I expected and I wasn't able to use my extra-long two-prong cord. I didn't see this called out in the product description, so if you are often in a situation where you're dealing with ungrounded outlets, be aware.",Arcadiy Kantor,

Lenovo,Lenovo - AC Adapter for Select Lenovo Yoga Laptops - Black,Doesn't Work and Likely Unsafe - Recommend Avoiding,I've had absolutely terrible luck buying power adapters via vendors listed on amazon. Every single one has had power issues. I strongly suspect that these are sham producers with horrible quality control. The adapter I purchased here causes my laptop power to flicker on and off repeatedly. I would consider unsafe to leave it plugged in. The only thing I can recommend is to buy brand name products directly from the manufacturer. I've been an amazon customer for probably a decade. This is only the 2nd or 3rd review I've written.,Sports,

Today (33 days after the purchase date) the adapter decided to stop working. Obviously I've just missed the returned window so I am left with a piece of junk.Beware that this adapter uses a triple-pronged plug, which is different from the picture shown in the description. I thought it was no big deal but it wouldn't work with any type of extension cord. It only charged (when it still worked) when plugged directly to a power outlet. Not recommended!",Thuc Nguyen,
Lenovo,Lenovo - AC Adapter for Select Lenovo Yoga Laptops - Black,Don't believe the FAQs!,"This works alright and is the correct adapter, but I had to make an emergency drive to a Radio Shack to purchase the missing other half that plugs into the wall. While all the FAQs I read stated that it included that part, sadly it did not. I drove to several electronic stores before one mentioned Radio Shack who had the power cord for the adapter available for me. It doubled my purchase price, but I was traveling, needed the adapter, and had no other choice, so I had to purchase it in two parts with two payments to two different entities.

Basically, the charger is useless to me.You may notice that this one costs 20 whereas the same thing from Lenovo, Best Buy etc. is in the 40+ range. There's a reason - this is a knockoff, despite the Lenovo labeling all over it. The biggest giveaway is that this one lacks a barcode - all Lenovo chargers should have a barcode which contains model number, serial number etc. but this one does not. There are probably other ways to tell this one is fake, but that was the most obvious.Perhaps these may work for some people. But if your laptop is essential for your life in general (as it is for me), then spend the extra and buy genuine. It's worth it.",Andrew D. Royappa,

It's worth noting however that while the adapter I got has the new slim-tip connector, it is not a slim adapter - just a typical brick. The listing isn't exactly clear on this. Also worth noting that I ordered from Notebook Parts Outlet and received a 65W adapter due to stock issues with the 45W - not exactly what I was looking for due to weight reasons, but it works as well (and they refunded my shipping charges when questioned about this).",RS232 port,

I’m normally a Corsair only guy when it comes to RAM and bought these because I was in a pinch but they have performed remarkably well.

It's been having problems with overclocking games especially when the graphics get very animated. In the middle of a big battle, having the screen freeze or pixilate makes a person want to chuck the keyboard across the room. After looking into the cost of upgrading the memory, video card, and processor versus the cost of a new tower, it was s bit of a toss up. When this DD4 memory became available, it was enough to sway my choice and I'm very glad I did. I though with a new video card and upgraded AMD processor games played much better, but with this new memory upgrade on board, WOW.These sticks are very easy to install, and I like that their open design helps to dissipate heat. They took just a few minutes to physically install and then a few more while the computer recognized and adapted to the upgrade. There are zero problems now with overclocking. Everything runs beautifully and smoothly, from Fallout 4 to crazy cat videos on the interwebs.

Pny,PNY Anarchy 16GB Kit (2x8GB) DDR4 2400MHz (PC4-19200) CL15 Desktop Memory (BLUE) - MD16GK2D4240015AB,Unbelievably tunes up an older computer to lightning speeds,"It's amazing how a small investment can make it seem like you have an entirely brand new computer. That's what the PNY Anarchy memory did for an old(ish) desktop. Extremely easy to install (that all depends upon how easy it is to get to your memory slots in my case, simplicity.) There's absolutely no comparison now between how it used to lollygag along and how it literally zooms! I'm sure for folks with the latest and greatest and best of everything, it will seem like a noticeable speed improvement. For the rest of us, though, who have to make do with what we've got, computer-wise, the change in how responsive the computer is will be breathtaking.When you're on a budget anything in the 100-range isn't cheap. But when you see the difference in how your old computer behaves and responds, believe me, you will agree it is worth the money!",ByKaty Lake,5

Pny,PNY Anarchy 16GB Kit (2x8GB) DDR4 2400MHz (PC4-19200) CL15 Desktop Memory (BLUE) - MD16GK2D4240015AB,So So Performance,My grandson who put these in his Dell XPS 8900 says there's no appreciable gain in speed and in fact a decided uptick in latency (whatever that is). He had two 8gb ddr4 chips and one died already so he wanted to replace them with these four PNY Anarchy chips to maintain his 16gb level or Ram. He says in fairness that part of the problem may be Dell's use of GTX-730 discrete graphics (something to do with response times I believe he said) instead of a better choice and trying to build a gaming computer pairing that particular GTX-730 with this brand new processor. He's replacing the graphics and said he'd let me know if it shows any improvements in ram performance. He said that benchmarking the DDR4's tho didn't really show much difference in performance with equivalent DDR3 chips.None of that means anything to me at all but he is a dedicated gamer and knows his systems. He said he'd give them about three stars on a five star scale so I'm carrying it over into my review because he knows his stuff. He also said who'd use 4GB's in this day and age when a gamer would take a four slot board to 32 GBs of ram instead.So for whatever it's worth there's my review. I hope it means something to you and helps you decide because this time I was decidedly out of my depth.,ByRichard The Buying Hearted,3

Unfortunately, I only had two available, so I put two in mine and the other two in my significant others computer so that worked out great. The hardest part of installing these was having to get down in the floor and drag my tower out of the cabinet. Cough cough, I need to dust under there. Opening the case of the tower was easy, and locating the slots was also easy. First I blew the inside clean with a can of air, then I popped the cards in and put everything back to how it was. Once everything was set up I could tell the difference right away. My computer seems to be responding more quickly. Everything was pretty easy and I was back up and running in no time and my computer isn't nearly as sluggish as it was.I actually bought a new computer about a month ago because my computer was so sluggish and it is still sitting in the box waiting for the old one to finally give out, but it's still holding strong and now I think it might actually be a while longer than I thought before I have to finally break it out and set it up.

Added to his existing 16GB, the now total of 32GB makes his system hum like a song. His older RAM still onboard is Samsung, but there are no conflicts. We've encountered no errors and he's reported zero latency in gaming since the upgrade. Everything was getting sluggish as he had done software upgrades, so the added RAM was perfectly timed. The lifetime warranty is a no-brainer on selecting this brand. I was grounded with a grounding strap when I installed the memory, so no worries there - but memory can fail. It's nice to know that if that ever comes up, we're covered.",ByShelley Gammon,5

Pny,PNY Anarchy 16GB Kit (2x8GB) DDR4 2400MHz (PC4-19200) CL15 Desktop Memory (BLUE) - MD16GK2D4240015AB,Great RAM which can be found much cheaper in store,"I ran this RAM at 2133 MHz because at the time I had a 6th gen Intel processor. I really did not have any issues with the product except for the fact that on several non Z series mobos (MSI, Gygabyte) it would only run in single channel mode and unfortunately did not have a Intel XMP profile (really not a big deal if you research stable OC voltages and don't get hung up on stuff you don't need). But none the less I was able to play any game I wanted with ease. 16 GB at 2133 really is more than most people need and chances are if you are just beginning to build your own PC this will be an extremely good upgrade. It runs very fast, stable and most of all cool. I am posting some pics below and this setup has never ran past 28 degrees even when I have increased voltages. A good tip for any new builder is to just spend the extra cash on a Z series mobo so you can really play with and learn what your RAM and CPU can do. PNY has also honored their lifetime warranty for me with two other products with little hassle so I can't complain. Do some digging around and you will find this is a great $90-110 upgrade. PNY is great via email but not so much by phone btw.",Danny,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,"Didn't work, got returned","Purchased this in hopes that someone could set it up for me to record and watch NCAA Football games overseas when I travel. I did so despite reservations that Sling no longer provides support, updates, etc. Three competent people worked with me on it (a guy who installs cable for a major cable company, an IT prof for a large office, and a guy who works does audio/visual for a production studio). We couldn't get it to work - the slingbox could not recognize a cable box from Time Warner and multiple calls to Sling's support did not solve the problem.I used to use sling for several years and even used the hopper by dish with good success. Looks like they have fallen off in their support with all the competition.

Just upload the ""slingplayer"" app to your phone or computer, connect to your slingbox and watch TV on your phone or computer. You can also put a streaming device [like Roku] on your TV and watch LIVE TV ANYWHERE!",auggie,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Worth the investment of you travel.,i live away from sports teams I follow. I put the sling box on a spare TV in a family members house so I can keep up with sports teams. The new model allows me to broadcast to my roku from my phone. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it techs a minimal amount of tech savvy to set up,John,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great Item for Frequent Traveler's,Older versions of this item seemed to get negative reviews but so far we are very happy with our purchase. We've had it for 2 months and are satisfied. Obviously it only works as well as the internet connection that you have at your physical location. Sometimes working the remote via your laptop can be painfully slow and tedious but the HD quality and overall experience is better than expected.,AdaK,4

I am a big fan of the technology.This new one works well, but the Windows applications to support it are buggy and need more work. The Android and Web interface work OK, but if you leave the SlingBox app running in the background on your Android phone it will suck your battery dry!Other then those few complaints I love my SlingBox.",SlingBoxFan,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,So far not working as promised...,I have not been able to get video over my wireless connection but can hear audio just fine. Not sure if it might be an issue with the fios cable box emitting the video correctly.,Hiltop,3
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Works exactly as advertised,"Ensure you have a pretty solid internet connection before purchasing a Slingbox device. Considering you are most likely streaming content from hundreds of miles away or more, you want to be wired or as close to the wireless access point as possible (both your computer as well as this device you will set up next to the TV).Setup is extremely easy using a phone. Takes less than 10 minutes total.Downloading the software for your computer is annoying as it is riddled with ads (every time you log on to watch, at least two ads pasted on page if you are NOT on fullscreen).The page can freeze or crash the script often. This means you'll want to skip commercials or pause the show but will have to wait for a response or refresh the page before being able to do that. It's happened with folks on multiple browsers unfortunately.Despite these minor annoyances, this is the best legal way to get your shows/content wherever you want them.",thatoneguy,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,This model works,Had a previous model a year ago and had to return it as could not make it visible over my internet connection.

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Just ok,Doesn't work well with chromecast. Does ok with roku. I have a lot of pauses & buffering but that's probably due to slow internet speed.,pgg4,2

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Very good entertainment system,We already owned a first version and we were very happy and to see a higher picture quality we update to M2 it's a new world,isi1,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,"Works well, but no surround sound when streaming.","So far I've been pretty happy with the purchase, but found out after purchasing it, it does not have the capability to output 5.1 sound when streaming. I also had some issues when using Ethernet instead of wifi. Usually Ethernet is more reliable and faster, but that is not the case with my slingbox. I'm not sure if it is hardware or software, but I dropped connection all the time when using Ethernet, so I went back to using wifi and it works fine again.",Khorn,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Connection issues,"In order to work you need component cables, not HDMI. My cable box only has HDMI.",Bjork,2
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great for TV at or away from home.,I mostly got this to be able to watch TV on a TV on our patio so that I wouldn't have to sting cable outside and get an additional receiver (and the charge that comes with it). Works great and apps are available for both apple and fire devices that are free. But the free apps when I watch on the computer start with an ad - which I don't care for - just there is just one. I believe you can buy the paid app which doesn't have ads. I have only used once while away from home and it worked good. Quality is dependent on internet speed.,scantrouge,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,I had higher expections,"It works well, but I had higher expectations.1. Only can record or play back one show2. limited to one tuner and TV3. Requires high upload internet speeds from your home network4. when using remote from your remote device, picture will skip5. only One device can review Play back.6. No HDMI connection -- what the heck this is 2015!7. The free version of their playback app for your device has Ads and their not Ad player is pricy.I bought this to stream from my direct TV to my office. The box will upload the content from your internet to their servers. Then you can view the content on your device that is streamed by their servers. For me, this is a heavy load on my network traffic because it is coming back and forth to the modem/router. I attach everything with Ethernet cable on a 1gb LAN, but still get choppy video's, video single lost or message internet connection is poor. I have not had time to research this but suspect my modem is the bottle neck. It is supplied by Grande and I suspect they are designed more for download then upload speeds.On the Positive side it does work, and you can power on your tuner remotely from their app. This handy if you device is in power saving mode.I am saying No to recommend, but ask someone if they asked how are they going to use it and then give pros and cons",kensurferca,3
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great product,My husband and I were due for a new Slingbox. We purchased this after all the positive reviews. Great product!,TaraC,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,"Ok, not great.","Slingbox works, the problem is that it often drops out to the point of being annoying. I have high speed Internet at both my home and my vacation place 200 mIles away. I'm able to access my fios account from afar, using my smartphone and Chromecast. Ithe seems to work better at non peak use times. I'll probably keep it, but it is overrated.",Way2slo,3
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Nice,Do the job. Haven't had any problems yet with the product,Ddddd,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Does the job,I had to upgrade my slingbox from the classic due to my directv box upgrade. It does the job well. There are some streaming hiccups here and there but I think it may be my network. The Mac app doesn't work with this slingbox but the web browser does work. The iOS apps still work fine with this one.,Pharmdsmith,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great Product,The product was easy to install. It works great for viewing TV on any device.,ChrisC,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,"Works well, but not with WPA2 personal wifi","The Slingbox M2 works as advertised. You'll need to download the free app for your phone or tablet. I would have given it 5 stars, except the M2 could not authenticate using the wireless mode with WPA2 Personal encryption and a long wifi password. (Mine is over 50 characters.) Short passwords worked, but are less secure, and in my case, I was unwilling to change the passwords on all my other wireless devices to accommodate this design defect. So, I elected to connect the M2 via an ethernet cable instead.",Pokerbob,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great for TV when on the go - wireless is avg,"I used this for the first year and had one complaint which was the wireless connection would drop frequently. My router is only about 15 steps from the m2 but I did not have Ethernet connection in that room. Once I switched connection to one of the those Ethernet over your electrical outlet, the m2 works great. So in summary, great functionality but wireless is not reliably. Connect somehow over ethernet cable and no more drops.",NickIO,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,This works and I highly recommend it!,Set up was easy and worked right out of the box. It's small and doesn't take up much space which is a bonus. The only consideration is the wifi internet upstream. There are times when the screen freezes but the technology works great and worth it.,TechGuy,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great discovery for travelers,"As a frequent traveler outside the US, I was constantly frustrated at not being able to watch the TV shows that I love. After hearing about Slingbox I researched it as a viable connection of my TV service to a personal up streaming service that I could watch anytime, anywhere. I discussed my needs with the Best Buy staff and finally selected this model. As I write this I am in a weeks-long trip in which I have been able to watch TV shows and my own recorded shows directly from my box! One of the best recent technical discoveries in our household.",JWilliams,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great buy,I love this purchase. I only wish I bought a model where I don't interfere with someone watching the same cable box the sling box is hooked up to....other than that it's a great buy!!,JahsFinest,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Easy and quick setup,Set up was faster than I expected but you do need to reset your output if you switch from component to s-video. Seems to have less drop-frames and freezes than the last model.,WilliamV,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Very handy.,Still learning it but so far it seems great for watching football when I'm away. Wish there was an easier way to sling to another tv though.,Reggie,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great for when your on the go!!!,I have had the first generation of Sling Box and this is a well deserved upgrade!!! With wifi availability and the available HD connections make this a no brainier to have in your home.

Back when it was first released I dropped $15 for it!!!,Machine66,5

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Works well.,"Purchased this instead of having a cable box in the kitchen. So far it works well, but the are some quirks. It can be a little temperamental the when it comes to setting it up with the Xfinity X1 platform. The guide won't load all the channels and the app itself does need a little work, especially if you buy the app at $15.",Riggs83,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Slingbox M2 Works Great!,"I got the M2 so that I would have unlimited downloads for free. The M1 is pay as you go. The M2 along with their recommended HDMI/Composite Video splitter works great. The hardware is fairly low profile and set up was easy. The M2 has built in Wi-Fi, but I opted to direct connect since I had a LAN port available. One thing to note is the location to set up. I set up in the mail family room, but I learned that when I access Slingbox from my android phone, it will take over the family room TV. I may move the M2 to my bedroom TV location so I don't impact the family room TV that could be in more use. Bottomline, if you want your TV/DVR programming available anywhere, Slingbox is the way to go.",BDANIELS,5

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Sling works good but HDMI needs a component box.,Still had to purchase a component box to allow A side video stream to my remote TV. This is necessary with HDMI signals coming off cable box. Most everything has moved to HDMI connection so why not just build it in. This is a good reason to stay with the M2 and not a higher set from sling box.,Mike,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Sling Box offers a wide variety of viewing,"Positive Review:Sling Box offers the ability to stream important live television viewership from your home box TV to your laptop or tablet.The ability to view live TV anywhere in the world is truly amazing and given the strong bandwidth connection, the streaming is 100% percent operational. I've personally tested this device from around the world and have had mix results but this was all due to poor network connections, not the actual Sling Box itself.Basically, Sling Box is based on your network connections, if you are in a poor location with minimal strength while on a low bandwidth wireless connection, then you will lose the ability to stream 100% and will endure ""hiccups"" and possible re-connections.",Hans,5

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great media player!,"The Slingbox M2 was relatively easy to set up.The only drawback was the difficulty placing IR reader to ensure control of the box and I am only able to view the guide up to channel 100. I am able to view channels above 100 by pressing the numbers on the remote in the app. Once adjusted appropriately, it's not much of a problem.The picture quality is amazing on the phone, but on the Roku 3 it sometimes has the pixelating view watching sports.

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Works,I bought the first slingbox ever made available and had to replace it. This one did it. I probably use slingbox everyday and this one covers it. Worth the money if you want to take your tv (via internet/smart device)with you wherever there is wifi.,Grandpa,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Does NOT support all Windows,"I bought a previous Sling product because Best Buy said it supported Mac/Windows (like this one says). Used it for a while with my laptop on trips--worked fine--until Sling decided they would no longer support Vista. There was NO warning about this when I paid for it. Now I have a ridiculously expensive paper weight unless I buy a whole new laptop that I don't need. I expect Windows 7 support will be next to go away. I wouldn't even be concerned if I simply couldn't call in for support--no--it just doesn't work at all--check the internet (including their own site) for all kinds of disgruntled customers in the same boat. Unless you plan on throwing away money by continuously updating equipment and operating systems that you don't need, plan on this being obsolete as soon as Microsoft comes out with another operating system or two. (And that is only if you have Windows 10 now; if you have Windows 7 or 8, it will useless be sooner.) No more Sling products for me. Very poor recognition of customer needs.",Anonymous,1

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,"Very very good, not great","I use this at my vacation house, to avoid the need for an additional cable/satellite account. It works great for that, but the tablet software is a little buggy, but not bad. Works best with plenty of bandwidth, otherwise, there is some lag and buffering. I purchased to use with my Chromecast, and a few times, the Slingplayer software can't find the chromecast (even though the TV says they are connected).Install is very simple, great support.I recommend this, it does the job...but not perfect.",HuskyPeach,4

We live abroad, and now we can see all of our live Florida TV whenever we want. Picture quality is very good. The only thing we still have to correct with SlingBox is the remote control. When we want to pick our channel, it takes several tries to connect to the right channel. Other than that, we have already recommended it to several friends. Great when travelling as well!",ParkerLakes,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,A very nice product,I like this product very much.

Either way love the new product.,Jiti,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Works great!,I used the component connection from my cable box to the SlingBox and again from the SlingBox to the TV.Previously I had connected my cable box to the TV using an HDMI cable.

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Streaming Quality Subpar,"I purchased this as part of my move to NYC in an attempt to save some cash with cable costs and such. The Slingbox was connected at my parent's house in VA. We could never stream at HQ, only the medium quality. Not sure if this was attributed to the uploads/download speeds, but we have 50 mbps speeds at both ends, which I believe is pretty fast. Aside from the lackluster streaming quality, it was a pretty seamless installation. However, the fact that I couldn't stream at HQ leads me to a 3 star rating.",gohoos25,3

The setup was quick, easy, and straightforward. While it does use a lot of bandwidth, causing the product to disconnect on rare occasions, it is able to stream my shows at a high resolution onto an old I pad without much disruption. Streaming through an Apple TV, however, tends to be slow and the picture will freeze quite often. I would recommend using a device that has the sling box software native to the device (like a roku) to stream onto a tv.",Ktrumpc2433,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great device for away from home tv watching,The Slingbox is a really great device. It allows you to replicate essentially and your TV is by streaming into a device. If you use your phone or tablet it works perfectly. I also use it to stream to my Roku TV which works flawlessly. Donely downfall is that changing the channel does take a bit of patience. Of course since it is a stream it is not a direct channel change and takes about five seconds to load and D buff. Overall the streams work great as long as your Internet connection is good but that is obvious. The overall device is an excellent purchase. I highly recommend this device.,jjhippo,5

It streams live TV very well, and very clearly if you have a good WiFi connection. But I travel a lot and bought it to watch DVR recordings while in my hotel room. If I want to watch live TV I can just turn on the one in my room. Trying to watch recorded shows is very frustrating because of the extreme lag when using the fast-forward or rewind functions connected to my DVR at home. Also, if someone is watching TV at home, you are fighting over the same DVR/TV.",Paul,2
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,"Cast Stopped Working, Warranty Not Honored","After a few months, my slingbox stopped recognizing my Chromecast v. 2. The cast icon stopped showing in the slingplayer app (for Android) even though it shows and works fine in every other app I have that casts. I opened a ticket in May and was told that it was escalated. I was never contacted, though I was eventually told that the ticket was closed and that they tried to reach me but couldn't. This is impossible since I am on call. Of course, there is no resolution available based on that ticket. A new ticket was opened, and almost a month later, there is still no information. All I get is a runaround including repeatedly telling me that I emailed them that the problem was resolved because I emailed that a different problem with a different ticket was resolved.",mmmmpppp,1

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great casting device,"For anyone that's had it with annoying buffering from their cable company's TV streaming, get this little box. Initial setup can be a little confusing especially with WI-FI. Just make sure the Slingbox and device you're casting to are on the same network. Also make sure you download the phone, tablet, PC, or Mac specific app for each device. The tablet app for example will not work with your phone. App can be a bit temperamental at times, especially when trying to initially connect. Some of the app's graphic interface is not as intuitive as I would have liked. It takes a little while to learn how to navigate through the options. OK, now the pluses. The picture quality is great. True HD with very little or no buffering. I can even watch DVR recorded shows on my tablet. The coolest feature is the virtual TV remote. It’s an on-screen replica of your TV/cable remote. The free app has some startup ads, which are not overly intrusive. In fact, you can skip the commercial after a few seconds. A great little device (much smaller than I thought it would be) that very effectively acts as a second cable box. The somewhat minor caveats expressed above prevent me from giving it a full 5 stars.",BBfan61,4

I guess I was anxious to take it for a spin. Once setup it worked flawlessly in my home. Anywhere. Works great on iPhone or iPad. My daughter even uses her iPad to stream the feed to her Apple TV.

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Two months and still not working,"I wanted to be able to sling my DTV signal to a roku tv using a new Samsung Tablet as remote control over my home wifi network.. Before I bought these components I spoke with Sling support twice to assure it was a viable. I was told they recommended the use of a tablet as a phone's display was too small to serve as a remote control. It has been 2 months and the integration of these products does not yet work. The necessary ""cast icon"" never appears on the tablet to initiate the sling of the video. I have been escalated to level 3 support three weeks ago and there has never been a response. Then I read in their support forum that the issue has been around for 4 months before I bought the equipment. No resolution in sight. Today, I was told by Sling level 2 support that it also does not work with the Google Chromcast (as is advertised).. Sling acknowledges that this is a widespread issue and not native to my set-up, network or equipment. Buyer Beware",GaryK,1

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Very slick device,"I think this has to be one of my very best purchases of late. Hooked the device up according to the directions and was able to watch television through my cable box using every device I own, everywhere. And if you're really tech-savvy you can even gain access to the video stream itself and watch it in situations not officially supported, such as using a Linux OS.Quality scales very well, with several bit rates and resolutions available. Box automatically de-interlaces for all typical resolutions, except 1080 as far as I can tell. 1080 stream appears to be interlaced so deinterlacing must be performed client-side. The official Windows Slingplayer client does a decent enough job of this, but VLC has much better deinterlacing capabilities if you have the horsepower.Very happy with this purchase.

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Worse than the old Slingboxes,"I bought this to replace my old 10 year old Slingbox. This product is inferior. When watching via mobile, the signal will give out and go black after several minutes and not come back unless I close and restart the program. When watching at home using a laptop on the same network, the signal won't disappear completely... it will just go to a black screen every several minutes, but then continue streaming after a few seconds. Super annoying and I didn't have any of these issues with the old Slingbox. Plus there are ads on this Slingbox so I have to watch the ads again every time I restart because their signal is so poor.",BryS,1

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Works well - but not with divices updated to 10,This worked well until we updated our iPad to 10 - then it would not play on our TV - we had to change to control it with an iPhone that has not been updated,PamR,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Love my Slingbox,"I've been looking at Slingboxes for years and finally got one. Liked it so much that I bought my Son-in-Law one. I viewed mine when I was in the hospital for a week by hooking a FireStick to the hospital TV. The firestick is the easiest way to control the Slingbox, although the other ways are not hard. I use my Slingbox by means of the Firestick as a second program source for a second tv in my ManCave primarily.",StreamingFanatic,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Good enough,"We're using this box to forward television from across the Pacific ocean to our house in Minnesota. It works fine, but with some caveats.The specific country we're forwarding from isn't in the pre-defined list of countries the Slingbox supports, so we had to do some googling to find a compatible on-screen 'remote' for the cable box there. The other downside is that we can't reliably get the best quality video that the box supports. That's not a problem with the Slingbox, just an issue with the internet. Both the sending location and our house have internet packages that should easily support the highest quality. So keep in mind that the connection isn't entirely in your power to fix.",Samuel,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Does everything it's supposed to do.,I haven't had any trouble with it yet! ;) I think I may get another one!!,Jddisag,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great tool for location shifting TV programs,"Allows you to view your home satellite TV programs remotely on your laptop or phone.

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great!,"Love it, so now I can watch all of my live out of town sports teams when I'm on trips and all i need is an internet connection. It was easy to set up, just follow the instructions. The free smart phone app isn't best, but it gets the job done vs ponying up for the $15 they want.",akhobbes,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Open ports before setup!,"Appears to work pretty good, ran into issues during the installation with it not connecting to the internet. I had to open port 5301 on my router and it was smooth sailing afterwards! 9/11 would buy again.",thexdrizzle,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,not what I expected,I thought this was sling TV. This just let's you get your cable at a remote location.,Teri,1
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,SLINGBOX M2,The Slingbox M2 works well but slowly. Switching stations does not always happen from the first input which is frustrating. I chose this one over the HDMI upgraded one because the HDMI coding sometimes restricts transmission of HDMI quality movies and programs. The clarity on the M2 works well with us.,BOBD,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Best Buy Rep told me incorrect info,"When I was looking at this item, a Best Buy Rep assured me that it would NOT require the TV it was hooked up on to be on the same channel as the remote operator. In other words, if I was accessing it remotely and I wanted to watch a football game then my wife at home would be able to watch something different. I purchased it, set it up and it was the exact opposite of what the Best Buy Rep said. The TV/Cable box that it is hooked to will only display what is being called for by the remote user. I subsequently returned the product. I would recommend doing your own research and not relying on the experience of the Best Buy Reps. In addition, when the store manager in Danbury CT. read my account of what happened, he sent me an email asking for further info. I replied with the info. His solution was just to say sorry. Not acceptable for someone that had to travel an hour to the store, an hour home, an hour setting up the product, an hour traveling back to the store to return it and then an hour home. As an elite plus member I would have expected at least some type of discount coupon for my next purchase. I will not be shopping at Best Buy going forward and would recommend that you buy this and other electronic items elsewhere.",ConsultingTime,1
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Good streaming remotely,Bought specifically for usage when I am at another location without TV (don't want to spend the money). Combined it with a Roku at the remote location and works well. No need to spend the extra money for TV service. Only draw back was that it is HTMI only. So you would need to make sure your cable and TV has HTMI slots.,Kevin,4
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Excellent product.,"Works very well, workss as expected. Setup a bit tricky.",Linda,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Simple setup but not great with Comcast,Product works great but if you want to use it with Comcast you cannot have the box hooked up to your TV with the HDMI cable. Only one output signal will work at a time. If the M2 is the only thing hooked up to your (Comcast) box's output then it works as advertised.,Kevin,4

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Letting me cut cable,This device is allowing me to cut cable from our vacation home. I can now pay ONLY for internet service and watch my cable box from my primary residence when I'm at our 2nd place and don't have to pay monthly bills when i only use it a few days a month in the off season.There are some bugs- occasional buffering and cumbersome remote interface from the phone but saving $85/month eases any frustration.,WayneP,5

I was surprised to find out since I am not a cable subscriber, I couldn't access some of my taped shows without going through an online access with certain stations.

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Excellent product,"I travel outside of the country and was frustrated for a number of years for not being able to access college football and other programming. However, the slingbox has solved this problem. I can turn on the slingbox and my cablebox any time I want and watch my USA cable, for which I am already paying.Also, when using my iphone to watch TV, I noticed that the slingbox automatically disconnects itself if you did not disconnect it (maybe it is only my cablebox), so if you are connecting back with your phone after a day or two, it will seem like you do not have signal, but just press ""power"" on the system and the cablebox will go back on, and you can watch TV again. To avoid that when I am done watching TV in my phone, I now turn off the cablebox first and then disconnect from slingbox, and when I want to watch again, just connect and press ""power"". However, the software in computers makes it even easier, I just press watch TV and it takes care of everything. In conclusion, it is easy but you just have to figure out the details.Be aware that the signal quality and speed will depend on the internet at both ends.",iphoneuser,5

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Easy setup,Now I'm able to keep up with local news and all of my favorite channels while I'm out of town. Why shouldn't I be able to see the cable I pay for on all of my devices without having to pay more to view each one. Especially great if you have a vacation home and don't want to pay for enhanced channels in both places.,JB133,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,does the job,"for someone who wants to watch his or her team from another city, this can do the trick. ive been using this thing for a few weeks now and I am able to watch all of my games. it takes some time to get used to the device on the other side once it is set up, and if you have the amazon fire stick, you don't need to use your phone or tablet to watch on your tv, which is awesome. The biggest complaint i have is the quality of the video, but that can be because of my internet speed. I have 100mbps which comcast says is upgraded from the normal 25 mbps, but maybe it is still not enough to get the quality i was hoping for when streaming my tv from another city. all in all, i can watch my games, and there usually isn't too much that gets in the way of that once i got this thing all set up.",coolstuff123,4

I'd give it zero stars but the review module doesn't give me that option.,Kubli,1
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great while on vacation,Set up is a breeze and the picture quality depends on your Internet or cell phone signal. Only issue we've had so far is the commercials on the app. Other than that this does this trick to view your cable on the go.,AwkwardPanda,4

It has a great guide showing what is available to be watched on tv...hd channels filter..You can watch what is on your dvr. I haven't used this yet. I would suggest you have a separate dvr/or digital box to hook upto to so it doesn't hijack your main tv...I. e. if you are out of town and others are at your home watching your main tv you will be able to change the digital box channels it is plugged into. My main reason for purchase is to use at cottage and catch up on my dvr ...you just need wifi to watch.,darla37,5

Tried installing the software on one computer, but it froze up after installing and running. Tried installing on another computer and got a little further - it did see the Slingbox on the network. I got about halfway into configuring it but it hung up at the point where it was trying to configure the remote. Uninstalled the software, did a hard reset on the Slingbox, reconnected it to the wifi, tried again and it hung up in the same spot. Tried installing the Sligbox app on my Android tablet, thinking that might get further... alas, you can't configure the slingbox that way - you can only use it once it's already configured. At that point, I'd spent an hour of my life on this silly thing so I gave up and returned it.",DaviDurki,1

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Makes a Great Gift!,"I already have one of these for myself but I just recently bought one as a gift for a friend.... he absolutely loves it! Very helpful (especially when on vacation or traveling for work). One thing I noticed is that playback tends to buffer more frequently if you are connected or using it on a weaker wifi signal (especially when other people are also sharing the same signal). Overall, it's a great product and completely free to use while anywhere in the world (provided your on wifi). Works fine as well on your phone or tablet with a data plan but be aware that it will use some of your data if you do not have unlimited access. This device turned out to be a really huge hit for our family on a road trip last year because we were able to still watch some live football games and our favorite shows while traveling. Once your in a wifi zone, you can also wirelessly connect the slingbox to a larger TV screen by using a Roku stick and the slingplayer app (however, please note that the TV will need to have a USB port so that the Roku stick can be plugged into it).",MovieFan,5
Sling Media,Slingbox M2,"Cable anywhere, works great","I basically live at my girlfriends house but she doesnt have cable. As a big sports fan, I needed cable for specific channels that arent available through streaming apps such as NBC Sports, Fox Sports Go, or even Sling TV's a la carte packages (although they have lot to offer for monthly subscriptions less than what cable companies charge). I connected the slingbox to an extra cable box at my parents house and ive been able to pick it up through the Fire Stick at my girlfriend's house on the Sling Player app. As long as you have good networking in both locations the stream is pretty darn good. I downloaded the Sling Player app on my phone and I am able to watch TV at work as well. You can bring it anywhere. It is a great solution that has been a game changer.",Paul,5

Sling Media,Slingbox M2,Great casting device,"For anyone that's had it with annoying buffering from their cable company's TV streaming, get this little box. Initial setup can be a little confusing especially with WI-FI. Just make sure the Slingbox and device you're casting to are on the same network. Also make sure you download the phone, tablet, PC, or Mac specific app for each device. The tablet app for example will not work with your phone. App can be a bit temperamental at times, especially when trying to initially connect. Some of the app's graphic interface is not as intuitive as I would have liked. It takes a little while to learn how to navigate through the options. OK, now the pluses. The picture quality is great. True HD with very little or no buffering. I can even watch DVR recorded shows on my tablet. The coolest feature is the virtual TV remote. Its an on-screen replica of your TV/cable remote. The free app has some startup ads, which are not overly intrusive. In fact, you can skip the commercial after a few seconds. A great little device (much smaller than I thought it would be) that very effectively acts as a second cable box. The somewhat minor caveats expressed above prevent me from giving it a full 5 stars.",BBfan61,4

You can use Bluetooth, google cast, USB, and aux to play music. The battery life is pretty good too, and the build overall is great. My only issue with it is the sound. It has an EXTRA BASS mode yet my Bose Sound Link 2 has better sound quality and better bass. This model has more bells and whistles but is beat out by my other speaker in terms of sound quality. If I crank up the volume on this and the Bose Sound Link, the Bose wins in my opinion. While the h.ear go gets loud, it does not fill the room with sound as well as the Bose. If you want the extra bells and whistles I would say that this is a pretty good option. I on the other hand like the room filling sound of the other speaker, so I may switch to another one of those.",Brian,2

They looked like a gimmick. Then a friend played his smartphone music on his portable speaker. I decided to check some speakers out. Then I checked some more.... lots more. Absolutely I trusted my ears. This Sony speaker sound is FANTASTIC and POWERFUL to me. It is so simple by design, yet packed with versatile features, including Link, Network, Bluetooth, USB, Audio jack, Google Cast, Software upgrades when needed, and the ability to pair in Stereo to a second Sony speaker. The sound is distinctly different when you push Extra Bass. Both envelopes are great! You can release the speaker grille with a small toggle.

It seemed to have the most bang for the buck for a wireless and bluetooth speaker. In the end, I brought it back. I found that it lacked definition and was a bit too heavy on the bass side when you engaged the bass boost and it was too thin when it wasn't engaged. I bought a Yamaha WX-030 instead.

I was looking for a portable size speaker that could put out a crisp, clean sound with some rich bass to go with it. The only two to meet my expectations were the Bose Soundlink Mini 2 and the Sony. I'm a Bose fan, but in my opinion the Sony sounded even better. I did a little research and was impressed with the hi resolution specs of the Sony. It was also about $100 less than the Bose so I went for it and I've not been disappointed. I'm amazed how this miniature stereo can put out an appreciable amount of bass without sacrificing clarity. It outperforms speakers twice its size. I love it.",Jrpraptor,5

There is no question for the money it sounds better than the other major speaker makers by far. You wouldn't necessarily think this about Sony speakers (I can vouch for that) but I am telling you this speaker is perfect if you are looking for something portable that you can listen to LOUD or soft and still sound very very good. It's got a little weight to it, but that just makes it feel solidly made. Sony takes a lot of moonshots and this is one that I think is very worthy.",Aivdivad,5

I was in the market for a decent wireless bluetooth speaker, and I usually go with Sony products. I bought this on sale (about $30 off regular price) only because the box boasted Hi-Res Audio and Extra Bass. The sound quality coming out of this speaker is excellent. I could not ask for anything better. I am currently considering purchasing another to pair the two. The only faults of this speaker are the price and supported apps. Very confusing out of the box, but I guess the Song Pal app makes it easier to pair to it than just doing it without. BUY on sale.",Will,4
Sony,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,Nice little speaker,"Being able to test these speakers in the store really made this decision easy. I wanted something mainly for the garage and mainly for talk radio/podcast listening.

The big name, heavy bass brand of wireless speaker still has way too much bass even with the boost turned off.

Sony,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,Great speaker,"Sounds great. Good size. Only 2 complaints are that you can't pair 2 and use blue tooth and switching from surround sound. Pairing has to be through wifi, so you can't connect your Bluetooth device to 2 speakers at the same time without being on wifi. If you connect to a Sony sound bar and use 2 as surround speakers, it takes several steps to switch back to regular speakers instead of surround speakers. A setting in the app or on sound bar onscreen menu that easily toggled between music speakers and surround speakers would be great.",RobC,4

Sony,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,Best for adding to Google Home/Cast Environment,You can basically ignore the HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO features and focus on the unique skills this slightly hefty speaker has. Seamlessly joining with speaker groups in Google Home and Cast makes it useful even when you're not on the go.

You can also group it with another Sony speaker that has the same ability to pair with the HGI Hi-Res speaker via the SongPal app. This is a nice function if you really want to fill the room with a wider stereo sound or have music play in more than one room. There's a lot of options when it comes to portable wireless speakers and I recommend checking them out in store before purchasing.

Gullibly, and without doing due diligence, I bought it to use with my Alexa. The speaker does not stay powered on; even if plugged in to a power source. So, any time you want to use it after period of dormancy, you have to physically push the power button. Second issue: bought a Peleton bike, so figure I'll use this speaker for that instead; I got a Bose to use with Alexa. The Sony drops it's Bluetooth connection constantly; very irritating. I went to support; did factory reset, nothing. My bad; again; passing the return deadline; so I'm stuck with this lemon. In the time being, I bought a Bose Soundlink 2; works like a charm.

I was really hesitant on purchasing this speaker based on the negative reviews but I'm glad I bought it anyway. I love the sound that the speaker puts out (it's pretty loud and bass is also). I love the fact of being able to control the speaker with the SongPal app. I don't connect it to other speakers (yet) to have that surround sound effect so I don't use it via WiFi. I was torn between this and the Google speaker but the fact that Google doesn't support bluetooth helped make my mind up. The only ""complaint"" I have is the battery drains faster than I like and it doesn't charge well if you're using it.

Sony,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,High Quality & Excellent Sound!,"I use this speaker as part of a multi-room wireless setup for music throughout the house. The sound is very rich, and great for mids and highs. Amazing coming from such a relatively small speaker. There's an Extra Bass setting for heavy bass- but it sounds great and has plenty of bass as-is so I leave that feature turned off. If turned on it's too bass-heavy at higher volumes in my opinion. I have larger speakers and subs for that. I would highly recommend this speaker, even as a stand-alone portable unit as it can definitely hold its own, and it can be paired to another one for double the power. It's also VERY sturdy, it's got some heft to it as its interior is of steel construction, not cheap plastic. There are all sorts of settings you can select from using the Sony app for iOS or Android. It automatically turns on when activated via Apple AirPlay/Spotify/GoogleCast/Bluetooth (when you have the standby feature turned on) and it automatically turns off after 15 minutes of not being used. But you can adjust either feature using the app, amongst other options for sound, battery, network name, auto or manual updating via WiFi, etc. etc. This is obviously not a cheap speaker, so I'd never take it to the beach for example - I'd buy a much cheaper speaker for that!",SeanWestLosAngeles,5

Sony,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,Good Speaker with Minor Connection Issues,"I bought the Sony speaker specifically for its ability to be used with Chromecast Audio. While it does work and can be added to groups it does take about 30 seconds after turned on to actually show up on my android phone or ipad (Google Play Music) to actually show up. Also it seems to lose connection from time to time, but this could also be an issue with my network or that I have 5 Chromecast Audio's (Although I have a top class Orbi Router and my wifi signal shows as strong). I've looked into google to see if there is a limit to the amount of Chromecast Audio's or simply Chromecasts that can be allowed and have not found a limit. Aside from the infrequent connection issues which I've troubleshoot extensively the speak sounds good. It seems to hold a charge fairly well and produces enough sound to fill a small room. I would recommend this little speaker but only if you are trying to use it for Chromecast audio. That said, you could easily find a speaker that is just as loud for a good bit less; otherwise, its your best bet for built in Chromecast audio. I also would note that I find the Sony 'Hi Res' is a bit of a gimmick. Unless you have a very specific Sony audio product that includes this feature you will likely never get any use out of this anytime soon. I have a various android devices including the google pixel phone as well as an iPad Pro and neither support it (*Although it is said that in the Android O update (post nougat).",GoodTimes411,4

Sony,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,Solid Portable Speaker 7 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"Purchased to replace my 2012 UE Boombox. Spearker/Box has a lot of volume and purchased it to listen to music around the house and audio books in the car (got tired of the car/road drowning out my phone and don't have a connection to my car speakers). The volume is synced with the latest update for iPhone where the volume on the phone matches the speaker (first time I have experienced that with a speaker) making it so you don't have to get up and adjust the volume on the speaker when it is set too low (might not work on all devices, did not work for my iPhone5 that I use as an iPod/ haven't updated in a while). The construction is high quality and feels solid/well built. It has a line in for audio jack and a 'function' button to switch between Bluetooth, wireless, and line in. Not an audiophile, but I think it sounds crisper than the Bose SoundLink mini II and III and had comparable volume, battery life and size (but smaller and seemed just as good as the bigger SoundLink III). Also checked out the Sony Srs x77 and x88, which do not have usb charging connections or portable size. The x77 (not the new model/zr7, which has yet to be released as of 5/2/2016) also shuffled around the display at the store and thought it would fall off the table. The x88 does not have an internal battery, but performed better than comparable/higher priced sound bars. Love the size, volume and clarity I get from the box and can recommend it.",Tom V.,5
Sony,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,... expectations for the srs-hg1 and this little guy didn't disappoint. It's touted as the world's smallest hi-res speaker,"I had high expectations for the srs-hg1 and this little guy didn't disappoint. It's touted as the world's smallest hi-res speaker, and I'll keep my praise focused on its ability to handle hi-res (in the case of this speaker: a ceiling of 24 bit by 96 kHz) audio files. I've listened to a number of albums recorded at lower quality (the standard 16/44 256k variety) through it, and the speaker still sounds excellent for its size, but the H.ear go really sings when paired with a hi-res capable source.One significant trick up Sony's kimono is the ability to sync with their proprietary LDAC Bluetooth codec. LDAC allows wireless transmission of up to 900 kbps, and it sounds noticeably superior to aptx or sbc Bluetooth standards. Of course, you need a device capable of pushing LDAC (such as the NWZ Walkman players, or Xperia Z5 and later Sony smart phones) and a hi-res audio file to hear the LDAC effect. I'm syncing with the NWZ-A17 silver and Xperia Z5 phone, and they both sound amazing when paired with this speaker. A further feature of the H.ear go is the ability to connect via micro USB to your PC, at which point the H.ear go bypasses the sound card of your computer, using its own DAC to play hi-res files. I've tried this as well, and the quality is impressive.Perhaps you are not into hi-res music and you don't own a bunch of Sony kit. Well, I still think you still will be very pleased with the H.ear go. It's a great sounding portable speaker with great battery life and connectivity options. 200 is a reasonable price for this unit. Personally, I'm angling to pick up a second one so I can experience the stereo sound and multi-room features that pairing two or more of these speakers will provide.Read more",Amazon Customer,5

Sony,Sony Mini Digital Video Cassettes - DVC - 1 Hour,Best Mini DVC's Available,"Four years ago, I started using these Sony Mini DV Cassettes and was blown away by their quality! The tapes themselves capture excellent video and audio recordings, and they transfer this quality to my video editing software.I am also impressed with how durable these tapes are. When I travel internationally, these tapes sometimes get exposed to the heat and a lot of moisture. Although I don't encourage exposing them to the elements, these tapes have proved extremely durable. Part of what makes them so durable is that the engineering design protects the tape extremely well. Also, each Mini DV Cassette comes with it's own hard case, so they are extremely easy to transport and store.I strongly recommend these tapes to anyone who wants to produce a high-quality personal video. It may also be helpful to know that I have friends studying film at USC who have shot several independent films using these tapes. These are not the same materials that Hollywood uses, but it is encouraging to know that these tapes are capable of producing such a high quality video.",Nuno,5

Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,"Sounds Great, But Not Worth $300","I will start off by saying, I am using this speaker to play music in my office. The speaker sounds great at low volumes, but tends to distort and sound a little tinny at higher volumes. If this speaker were around $!50, it would probably be a 4 or 5 star for me, but for $300, I come to expect more. Fortunately, I got it open box so got a bit of a discount. The SongPal app is terrible as well.",weems,3
Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,"Excellent, High-Quality Speaker!","I own the full previous Sony line of speakers for wireless streaming all over my house... SRS-HG1 (kitchen), SRS-X77 (office - it blends nicely), SRS-X88 (bedroom) & SRS-X99 (living room), and now, the SRS-ZR7 (foyer/entryway). These are GREAT speakers, excellent fidelity, and while they're not cheap by any means, you really get what you pay for. Heavy, high-quality builds and excellent sound, that are also classy looking and compliement your décor. Sony's ""Music"" app on iOS allows you to adjust all sorts of settings, and rename your speakers however you like, which affects how they show up on AirPlay lists and GoogleCast. (Note: The ZR7 is not AirPlay or AirPlay 2 compatible). It's not the best app, but it works for making all of the adjustments. You can stream directly from Apple Music or Spotify without having to use Sony's Music app at all. If you have the money, and you're looking for a great-sounding speaker that will last for years - this IS the way to go. I have a Denon receiver and all Klipsch speakers for my home theater system, but I use these Sony speakers for wireless music throughout the house and I love it - excellent sound, also Hi-Res audio capable (except the X77). If you're looking for heavy bass, invest in a subwoofer - heavy bass mixed into a small-ish speaker = lackluster for sound. Overly heavy bass generally drowns out the high end and diminishes fidelity. The ZR7 (and the X88) have good bass though, and customizable EQs if you want to emphasize that end of the spectrum. So, if you're looking for something more high-end without spending ridiculous amounts of money, that have excellent sound and that will last for years to come, look no further!",Sean310,5
Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,Here come the Sonos killers. 2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"This is really a great piece of kit. It is very well built, easy enough to setup with Sony's mostly useless app, and has very flexible input options. The inputs are selectable with a capacitive button on the top of the device (or in the app). There is notably a lack of a play/pause button, but perhaps you can just use the power button (non-capacitive) to the same effect. Having some on-device controls would have been a nice touch.The Spotify Connect and Google Cast features work without a hitch. The device appears in the list of target devices in every app I tried. DLNA works great as well from Sony's app and from other clients like Synology's DS Audio. My Synology appeared in the network tab of the app with no fuss.This device successfully renders Hi-Res files, because, well, they are a thing and you likely have some. However, it is not clear to me that this device is actually capable of revealing any additional clarity or details that may (or may not) be present in such encodings. But I digress ...Concerning multi-room: If you are interested in Google Cast groups for multi-room, you will have to wait for a promised update from Google to use groups with this device (see Google Cast audio FAQs). I have not tested it with Sony's proprietary multi-room protocol, but why bother The tantalizing promise of the Cast protocol is that it is essentially open and the consumer (such as myself) can build a wireless multi-room system with components from different manufacturers. But not just yet .. I eagerly await the grouping update from Google.This device and devices like it will be the Sonos killer.Read more",The Headless Horseman,5

Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,Great addition to the HTNT5 Sound Bar,These Speakers were a great add on to the HTNT5 Sound bar. Once you get them linked and working The sound is amazing. The Suround sound needs to be relinked if you turn off the surround bar. I suggest using the app rather then having to do it through the remote and pressing buttons all the time. It doesn't seem to remember the devices if you turn off the Suround Sound Profile. Would be nice to be able to turn it on and off without having to Relink all the time,BakerGeckos,4

Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,Great sound,"I bought two of these with the Sony soundbar and wireless subwoofer to create a surround sound system. First off, Bluetooth streaming music from my phone, the sound is excellent and really fills the room. I've used just one and it sounds good but combine it with the surround sound system and it is amazing.As for use with the surround sound while watching a movie, I find the volume is subtle and sometimes not noticeable. On a few occasions I put the speaker to my ear to see if there was anything coming out which there was, just low. Having never had surround sound I am not sure if that is how it should work as I was expecting louder. Maybe the movies I've watched which were only a few were filmed with low volume backgrounds and I haven't put it to the test, just not sure. I'm more of a music guy anyway so I am very happy with the sound when playing music so I have no regrets in buying this.I will tweak some settings when I get around to it and see if maybe that is my issue and adjust my score but for now I think my 4 stars is honest based on my likes.",Dylnel,4
Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,Perfect solution for space and budget,"First let me say I am coming from a custom designed home theater system which had a large footprint.. while I am not an audiophile, I like my sound. My wife and I decided to downsize everything this year so the large system had to go. I listened to sounbars for the better part of 3 weeks an finally settled on the Sony ht-nt5. After multiple discounts and rewards points I purchased the nt5 and the ht-ct790 for a ridiculouslylow price. Got it all home but was missing the depth of my full sized system. I was going to live with it but my amazing wife surprised me with 2 zr7 wireless speakers for a full surround effect. In short... I love it. It's not for a purist but if you are looking to get the full surround sound effect it's a bargain. Setup is simple..you can do it with no prior experience with audio equipment. The sound is so realist my dogs react to nearly every creak ring or whistle coming through the system.get it on sale or buy one at a time. Not cheap but several thousand less than my original system. I just love it.",Relieffromaandroid,5
Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,Sounds good,The sound quality is very good for such a small speaker.

Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,NOT A GOOD BUY,"If you can; go for another brand, here is why:1-It has a very weak bass, not what SONY claims at all. the case of the speaker itself is of such thin plastic that makes the speaker just shake instead of sending the bass into the room or space.2- if you want a multi room system out of these speakers, it becomes very expensive, much more than a dedicated system like SONOS, and is becomes complicated, needing to buy a WIFI router and trying to piece all the components together with SONY""s Songpal. I tried it and got frustrated with the App. 3- the SONGPAL App (now called Music), is clumsy and works sometimes, and sometimes it does not. To make the speakers work with WIFI instead of Blueatooth you Must use a Router that supports WIFI PROTECTED MODE. otherwise you are stuck with Bluetooth only, meaning One speaker at a time, not stereo, or multi room.THE BIGGEST DEFEATER : ITS VERY POOR BASS.

Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,SRS-ZR7 delivers excellent sound for a small unit,"SRS-ZR7 delivers a strong sense of deep bass, doesn't distort, the bass actual sounds fuller and richer. never sounds thin, but you do get a greater presence from the high-mids and highs and less from the deepest lows.",Ninja,4
Sony,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,"Excellent, High-Quality Speaker!","I own the full previous Sony line of speakers for wireless streaming all over my house... SRS-HG1 (kitchen), SRS-X77 (office - it blends nicely), SRS-X88 (bedroom) & SRS-X99 (living room), and now, the SRS-ZR7 (foyer/entryway). These are GREAT speakers, excellent fidelity, and while they're not cheap by any means, you really get what you pay for. Heavy, high-quality builds and excellent sound, that are also classy looking and compliement your dcor. Sony's ""Music"" app on iOS allows you to adjust all sorts of settings, and rename your speakers however you like, which affects how they show up on AirPlay lists and GoogleCast. (Note: The ZR7 is not AirPlay or AirPlay 2 compatible). It's not the best app, but it works for making all of the adjustments. You can stream directly from Apple Music or Spotify without having to use Sony's Music app at all. If you have the money, and you're looking for a great-sounding speaker that will last for years - this IS the way to go. I have a Denon receiver and all Klipsch speakers for my home theater system, but I use these Sony speakers for wireless music throughout the house and I love it - excellent sound, also Hi-Res audio capable (except the X77). If you're looking for heavy bass, invest in a subwoofer - heavy bass mixed into a small-ish speaker = lackluster for sound. Overly heavy bass generally drowns out the high end and diminishes fidelity. The ZR7 (and the X88) have good bass though, and customizable EQs if you want to emphasize that end of the spectrum. So, if you're looking for something more high-end without spending ridiculous amounts of money, that have excellent sound and that will last for years to come, look no further!",Sean310,5

Toshiba,Toshiba - 3TB Internal Serial ATA III Hard Drive for Desktops,Not good,"My husband installed it and computer couldn't find it and when he did get to it, the drive kept ejecting on him. Took it back and got and got a 5TB external hard drive. So much better.",45Dodgeg,1
Toshiba,Toshiba - 3TB Internal Serial ATA III Hard Drive for Desktops,Nice Price,"I chose this one based on price. I've had other Toshiba drives in the past, and their return policy is odd, but it worked out OK.This drive runs hotter than the 2TB Seagate that it replaced, so you should be aware there will be about a 5 degree Celsius difference in heat output. This drive is also louder than the Seagate.The drive arrived as expected. It functions well. There were no cables nor screws included, so this is bare bones.",TallCinciTomD,4
Toshiba,Toshiba - 3TB Internal Serial ATA III Hard Drive for Desktops,"Cheap, barebones with a three year warranty","It's hard to do a perfect review on a hard drive, because one of the most important things is how well they store your data over time. You can't magically peek into the future and see whether these things will or won't die or give you problems along the way, so I'll try to keep it down to what I do know.This 3TB Toshiba drive replaced a 2TB Seagate that started having I/O errors when reading a small bit of data. Not wanting to risk waiting to see if that small error would become a bigger problem, I ordered this drive and had it shipped to me, which was processed and delivered faster than expected. Props to Best Buy and UPS for that.As for the drive itself, it has a three year warranty, but being larger than 2TB you'll have to format it using GPT rather than the old MBR standard, otherwise you won't be getting the full amount of space on the drive. Formatting will take a few hours, so after installing the drive don't expect to have it raring to go immediately.Speaking of installing, this is a bare-bones, no frills hard drive despite being in a retail box -- inside the cardboard you'll find a lot of foam padding to keep the drive protected, the drive itself within a protective bag, and a little warranty paper, but NOTHING ELSE. No screws, no cables, no instructions. Since I had extra parts and was familiar with the installation process, this was not a problem for me, but this drive is not a great choice for novices who have never poked around a computer's insides before.All said and done though, this Toshiba drive is doing its job, and seems to be a little faster and snappier than the old one it replaced. I can't really complain, and it has chugged along pretty much 24/7 in the several days its been since I got it. I did install a separate heatsink/fan to the bottom of the unit as well, just to help make sure that it wouldn't overheat, especially in this sweltering summer heat. So far though, it's been smooth sailing.",nftyw,5

Although I use an ipod, I prefer CDs in general and combining it with the receiver, which also has a radio, was convenient for me. I like the convenience of the remote and the sound quality is good. It doesn't have a whole lot of power to it, but I bought a set of Klipsch speakers because they were listed as being more efficient - not needing as much power. I have a medium-sized living room and I find this pairing to provide plenty of loudness for me. So this is a good choice as long as you don't need a lot of power or have efficient speakers.",Dean Myerson,
Yamaha,CRX-322 CD Receiver,Very good receiver.,"If you want a small stereo receiver there are few other products out there. This one has good quality and small size. I found sound quality excellent and the design well thought out. The remote is simple and intuitive yet controls all functions including bass, treble, and balance. Settings are retained even with complete power off. I am very happy with this design. Two small caveats, though. Note that there is only one external line input and this is via an 1/8 inch (3.5mm) jack. This is the modern standard and will fit most digital audio outputs. RCA to 1/8 adaptors are readily available and will work with most legacy stereo outputs. My one small disappointment is that the USB port (for flashdrive input which works good) does not have power when any other input is selected. This means that one can't power an mp3 player while using the receiver. The user manual describes this and it can be downloaded from their website. IMHO, it would be nice to have the USB port on the front panel and have it available for flash drives and charging, but this might be cost prohibitive as tablets like nexii draw much more current than flashdrives. Other than this very minor issue I find this to be a perfect receiver. I have it connected to my computer audio output and it provides great sound while allowing easy switching over to radio or cd.Update: After using this receiver for six months, I like it more than ever. I have found the flashdrive feature more useful than I expected. Instead of burning a cd, just copy music files to any flashdrive and you're set to go faster, easier, and cheaper. The sound is great, balance and tone controls work well, and the remote is well designed ie intuitive, simple to operate yet fully functional, and white so it can be seen in dark room. My only gripe now is that this model only comes in black. I believe they have other versions that come in colors with speakers. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of these again.",GrzMky,

Bottom line for me: combined with a pair of good bookshelf speakers and a subwoofer (the bass is a little weak, after all, it's a 4 speaker, that's why they put a subwoofer connect on it) the sound is good, and I am happy with it.",F.

DreamWave,"DreamWave - Tremor Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Green,Black","Heavy, bulky and not the best sound","When I opened the package and felt the heft of this speaker, I was sure this was going to be a winner. After pairing it with my Ipod and playing the first song, the disappointment set in. The sound quality was not as clear or crisp as the Bose or UE Megablast. It may be a good party speaker with better sound at higher volumes, but it just didn't pass my sound test at normal volumes.",Rick,2
Glengery,Alpine,"reliable, mostly.","there have been a few occasions where this device would not connect using the usb cable, however, it definitely was worth the money and it works very very well. there have been only a few occasions where i had to unplug my iPhone and replug it in for the device to connect properly. but seriously, that was only a few times and it works great and i am happy with my purchase. the only thing about the interface that i do not like is that not all apps are comparable, such as Waze map app. Other than the occasional connection issue, which really hasn't been a problem, and the lack of full app support, I would have given this device 5 stars. I am VERY happy that my Slacker radio works! Apple maps work great and so does siri for use of the phone and iMessages!! I am very happy with this Alpine!",fishon1005,4

Glengery,Alpine,Beautiful CarPlay head unit,"I purchased this item a few weeks ago and have been loving it. The instructions that come with the unit aren't that great, but there are detailed downloadable instructions online. The unit is about 3 deep since it does not have a CD reader. This is fine for me because I bought it for the CarPlay, not for CD reading.The ILX-007 comes in a box with the harness with wiring that is more than long enough, a trim plate for what I'm assuming are custom jobs, a microphone and clip, and an auxiliary cable bundle for reverse cameras and what not.You will need to wire the parking brake wire to the actual parking brake or to a bypass or it will be stuck on demo mode. Another option would be to turn the car on to accessory mode and touch the parking brake wire to chassis of the ILX-007 while turning of demo mode in the settings. There are other settings that are grayed out without this wired up, but you will have access to all audio settings. I plan on wiring up a bypass later on when I install an amplifier in my car and end up pulling out the harness.As far as usage goes, it's pretty easy to use if you're familiar with apple products. I like the dedicated Sir button, although I wish there was a way to map a button on my steering wheel to the Siri button. I tried to do this with the PAC unit that I purchased, but couldn't get it to work.Overall I am very pleased with the clean aesthetics of this unit, the ease of installation (especially for my first head unit install), and the functionality. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked for my opinion.",Steven Hernandez,

Glengery,Alpine,Very Nice,Works Great and has a lot of features. Only downside is that it is not BLUTOOTH....,ScottyXRay,5
Glengery,Alpine,Could benefit from some tweaking,"This is not a Bluetooth device so your phone has to be manually connected/disconnected each time you enter/ leave your car. Perhaps this helps with better sound quality. Also I cannot choose a previous track when pressing the rewind button. It only allows me to rewind the song that I am currently playing. When I return to my car and was playing a podcast, the Alpine unit does not recognize where I left off unless I speak the command to ""resume podcast"". Also the speaker does not work well as installed by bestbuy (adjacent to the rear view mirror ) when driving in my car at speeds greater than 40 mph because it picks up background noise. Disappointed by this unit. Would wait for 2nd or 3rd generation.",Sandrar,3

Glengery,Alpine,"For CarPlay and CarPlay only, your best option.","There's a few things a person should know about this stereo before purchasing it. One, if you don't have an iPhone, you are basically buying a very expensive AM/FM radio. For those with an iPhone, though, this stereo offers the simplest utilization of CarPlay over any other option. You plug in your iPhone and CarPlay opens. No sub-menus to work through. It's just there. You also have an AUX option that works with video (if your car is in park) that you can add a DVD player, CD player, XM radio or HD radio to.Second, a number of other reviews have pointed out that there is no bluetooth. That's technically correct, but there is a chance of that changing in the near future. The reason why there is no bluetooth currently is because CarPlay has no wireless option. But with iOS 9 launching in the fall, that will be added, and the iLX-007 is prepared to take advantage of it, with a chip included within that is either wifi or wifi/bluetooth hybrid. Either way, Alpine is apparently prepared to release a firmware update and/or bluetooth dongle to make the iLX-007 wireless in the fall. Pioneer is telling customers that their stereos will not be wireless compatible, so that's a big plus for Alpine if it comes to pass.Overall, though, I enjoy my iLX-007 and don't regret purchasing it. It's very minimalist, has a 7"" capacitive screen and a physical Siri button. I was also able to hook a backup camera to it and steering wheel controls work with it (with an adapter). If you're looking for the same things I was in a double din stereo (namely, CarPlay), this is the one to get. It's a great unit that may get even greater in the near future.",ErikH,5
Glengery,Alpine,Very easy to use,"If you are an iPhone user this unit works just like the phone. Only cons at there aren't many apps that are CarPlay compatable, and without your phone it's really just a radio. A little pricey for its capability.",Curtis66,4

It feels like using your iPhone directly in your car. The hands free talking works great and the microphone is providing good sound to the person on the other end of the line.There are a few things I want to mention that are useful to know before purchasing this system. It will only connect your phone via usb-lightning cable. There is no bluetooth option available for your iphone which I would prefer. I would also like Apple Car Play to come out with an update that integrates Apple Music and the availability to search for songs and play them.",Marc,4

No Bluetooth, but at least I'm charging my phone while connected. The volume is a touch screen button. I miss the knob, but hopefully you have steering wheel volume controls. It works great as a touch screen button with hardly any hesitation, but the touch area is small and maybe frustrating when looking for it while driving.

Glengery,Alpine,For iPhone enthusiasts,"Apple CarPlay is here and it's clean interface is what is going to attract many buyers. I do enjoy the fast and simple interface that functions almost exactly as any Apple product many have come to know. It is the sole reason I personally purchased the deck and overall am quite pleased with it. It is super basic which is understandable to keep the driver's eyes on the road and not the display. For music it's a home run and for navigation it's a bit of a disappointment. There is NO Bluetooth connectivity which is a bit of a bummer and the phone mirrors the app on the screen which is a negative in my opinion. Alpine quality is there, but it's far from perfect.",Superwildcard,4
Glengery,Alpine,Most of the functionality is good only 2 issues,The only issues are the volume buttons are too small and poorly situated.

The processor is very slow (Alpine went way cheap on this) it's laggy and a few of the apps don't work great, like Spotify, I find myself controlling the head unit with my phone more often than using the HU. When you turn it off the clock doesn't display, NO BLUETOOTH and it needs a mid range setting. It works fine for Apple maps. This is Alpines attempt at car play making an entry level HU lacking quality internal components but way over charging on price. If I had to do over I'd buy the Pioneer version.",pmgia,3
Glengery,Alpine,Great extension for iphone,"Waited for six months while I did some research on this device. I know no Bluetooth on this device is a game changer (negatively) for some, but I have not been a great fan of Bluetooth. And as I can charge my iPhone with it, I actually prefer this non Bluetooth version.Heard Bluetooth is coming.Used it for over a week and it is better than I'd hoped for. using Siri has been very useful. There is still some things ""she"" gets confused about, but overall makes ""hands free"" driving very possible.I would recommend steering wheel controls if possible, as that makes hands free more realistic.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.",Datahamo,5
Glengery,Alpine,THE choice if you are using Apple Music,"This unit is total integration of your iPhone 5 or 6 and your car stereo. Here is what I love about this simple radio. 1. In the brightest sunlight and wearing polarized sunglasses you can see it clearly! 2. You may listen seamlessly to Apple Music, Apple Radio (e.g., Beats 1) or your music from the Cloud or on your phone. 3. Siri integration! The simple touch of the button brings up the double chime. You can ask anything...directions to the nearest gas station, start playing music from the Carpenters, etc. 4. Integration with Apple Maps so that you can easily navigate with audio directions. Without your phone, this unit is only an AM and FM radio. If you happen to have XM or Sirius on your phone, or for that matter Spotify or Pandora, this will play through the unit. Oh...and your phone charges through the lightening connector while you drive. No Bluetooth (although this may come soon) but honestly music sounds and streams better over the tethered lightning connector. This unit is superb and I cannot compliment Best Buy technicians enough on how they install this unit in your vehicle and integrate it seamlessly into its interior. Love at first sight and first listening...and now the love is deepening!",Louahvull,5

Glengery,Alpine,"Don't like Apple Maps, Spotify CarPlay is bug city","I replaced my Pioneer AppRadio 2 with the Alpine iLX-007. The AppRadio was the worst, full of bugs; new app releases were like rolling the dice.I was excited about CarPlay and I'm depending on Apple to handle software where Pioneer was inept. So the unit works great and is responsive. But there are two big problems:1# Spotify doesn't work 3/4 of the time. I asked Alpine Tech Support #much more responsive and nicer than Pioneer's# if they had a procedure to bring back Spotify to life, they did not. They said that this is an Apple problem and they must fix it.2) The CarPlay version of Apple Maps has two problems. First, you cannot use the touch screen to move or size the map like you do on the iPhone. Instead you have to bounce around with buttons for zooming and moving. Really stupid!Also traffic doesn't seem to work in CarPlay. Even on the iPhone, traffic is terrible and doesn't show as black, red, yellow or green like in all other map apps like Google Maps. Please Apple, its not that hard to know what people like! It would seem that the 34 Car Manufacturers listed on Apple's CarPlay site would expect stuff to be a lot better. Too bad Alpine gets beat up for Apple's ineptness.Things Alpine #non CarPlay) needs to improve:1) No way to turn off the AM/FM Radio2) The Graphic EQ screen can only be accessed from the iPhone's screen, not the Car Unit. Really?",SDL,3

Glengery,Alpine,Waste of money,"I bought this product with the understanding that it did more than my phone already did, well it does not it. First off the apps that are available are very limited, Pandora being the main one. There is iHeart radio, and a couple others but, most of us use pandora. Second a big screen and you can not watch any media content, there is a park brake switch, and safety features, so why not? This radio serves no other purpose than acting as a phone and half the time you can't hear the person or they can't hear you if you have the AC/heat on or any window down. You can't talk to text or ask Siri anything for the same reason. I would rather have my factory system, and my 800 I spent on everything. This head unit/ display panel offers nothing but a credit card payment or a lighter wallet. Save your money do something fun, like a weekend at the beach.",MrMe,1
Glengery,Alpine,Excellent radio,"Its a very good unit and works exactly as you would expect a $500 piece of equipment to work. The mic is excellent during phone calls and while ""telling"" the unit what to do. The available apps like messages is perfect and easy to use, the maps display is great. The biggest drawback is its price followed by the fact that its not wireless than the limited apps that can be displayed. In addition I too like several other buyers agree that the volume control is entirely too sensitive. Overall happy but still questioning whether it was worth the price.",EBGB,4

At first I thought the Kenwood had better touch screen response but the Alpine worked great after a few minutes of getting use to the touch screen. The sound quality is really good and the unit has a ton of pre sets and adjustments for EQ.

Glengery,Alpine,Great Apple CarPlay Radio,"I've been an Apple user for 15 years. I've enjoyed all of their products and services. I chose this radio over the Pioneer CarPlay radios because Alpine's implementation of CarPlay was the purest and simplest. After having this radio for a few weeks, I can say there are 2 downsides. 1) there is no CD player (not a big issue for me), and 2) I miss the tactile feel of a volume button. Alpine uses a touch-screen like button for volume which forces you to look at the display to change the volume (my car lacks steering wheel controls). I love the Siri button! It makes everything so simple.One of the main reasons I bought this stereo is the city of Austin, Texas implemented new laws which makes it illegal to hold your cell phone and to drive. The Siri integration allows me to make calls and send texts without touching my phone.For those of you who have noticed this radios lack of Bluetooth or Wifi, just wait. There are a few a secrets which will be unlocked during a future firmware update, perhaps this summer. This should help justify its relatively high price. So far I am enjoying trying out all of the CarPlay compatible apps on my iPhone. - Please note the associated photo is not mine, it was taken from a Reddit post",LonghornFan,5

Glengery,Alpine,The best iPhone-ready deck,"Installed it and love it. Looks very much like it was designed from scratch to pair with iPhones and preserves an iOS look and feel. CarPlay is extremely intuitive with zero installation. Just connect to USB3 port and go.

Also not for Android users (obviously).",CrystalBluePersuasion,5

Glengery,Alpine,Awesomness,Have this radio installed in my car and I love it. I have seen a lot of people complain about Apple CarPlay in general because it doesn't support a lot of apps. What I have discovered is that it may not support apps like Waze but it still allows you to use it and hear the audio over the speakers while still listening to your favorite music. Which is fine for me as I have my phone mounted high on the dash.,Glack,5

Glengery,Alpine,Good Speakers But Probably Not Good Enough,"I bought these speakers from Best Buy for 100. That was a mistake! I should've bought them from Amazon!I have these speakers hooked up to a kenwood amp putting the required RMS power to them, so the speakers frankly have everything they need to perform as good as they will. I am happy with them but I believe I could've probably bought better speakers for the same amount of money. The base is good, the mids are okay and the highs are okay. By no means do these speakers suck. They are far better than my stock '98 4Runner speakers.However every now and then on higher volumes you can hear the tweeters crack a little bit. Indeed, as so many reviewers before me have said, the crossovers supplied with the speakers really don't do a good enough job of keeping the lower mid-range frequencies away (keep in mind that my amp is set to keep all base frequencies away from these speakers, so if you don't have any type of crossover before your speakers this issue could even be worse!). This isn't a huge deal as at the volumes I'm talking about your ears are hurting, HOWEVER, what about when I want to open the doors and use my system to keep me company while doing some yard work or while camping I see myself using these speakers as I see fit regardless of how much damage I do to them. If they finally die on my due to my abuse I'll just replace them with a different brand - a brand that doesn't have these tweeter clipping problems.I am happy with my purchase but I'm not ecstatic - and as a consumer, don't we all want to feel like we have superior components that didn't stab our wallets as well Isn't that why most of us purchase good online in the first placeI recommend you go elsewhere for your needs. In my research many people seem to have great things to say about Rocksford Fosgate. In the past I have had great experiences with Boston Acoustics and Kenwood speakers.",listensilent,
Glengery,Alpine,Amazing sound,"The sound amazing. They are crystal clear. You can hear the full range of music. Sounds good with everything from hip hop to heavy metal with a pounding double bass. It took a bit of work to hve them installed properly. It was worth it to take my time and do it right. I had to dremel the tweeter holes in my door but after much calculating and aiming, I don't think a professional couldve done any better.Very worth my investment",Joshua Perlow,
Glengery,Alpine,Best sounding speakers I've owned yet,"I have a 2001 Honda Insight... tiny tiny car. The stock sound system is probably the worst sound system ever installed in a factory car since the 70's. Seriously. So I've embarked on a budget sound-improvement odyssey and these speakers are the step which finally made it really work.My first step when I got the car was to replace the (paper!) door speakers with a pair of Pioneer Coaxials. Cheap but they dropped right in and helped a lot. But the sound was still definitely low-fi. So I replaced the radio with a Dual unit on sale from Best Buy. It got good reviews for sound quality and had lots of bells and whistles for the money. Noticeable improvement in the sound but still lacked something. I added an 8 Kicker L5 sub in a custom box with a 300 watt amp. Very nice improvement in the low-end but the sound was still lacking. Mostly the high's seemed both shrill and muddy at the same time. Tinny, harsh. It was kind of awful at high volumes, it made me cringe sometimes and I'm no audio snob. I just couldn't take it. Turning down the treble just made harsh music with no treble. I wondered if it was resonance from my doors making such a terrible sound. So I took the doors apart and put in sound-deadening material. It made no difference.Finally I went to Best Buy and tested all the speakers they had on display. These Alpine Components sounded the best to me mostly the highs just seemed smoother than all the others, and they were on sale for very cheap. Installation was a bit tricky, both because of the separate tweeter and because the speaker has a bigger magnet than stock. It also required use of the included adapter ring and a fair amount of minor cutting and dremelling of the speaker cups to get everything to fit.Read more",Whirledtraveller,
Glengery,Alpine,Amazing sound!!,"The sound amazing. They are crystal clear. You can hear the full range of music. Sounds good with everything from hip hop to heavy metal with a pounding double bass.

Glengery,Alpine,Don't listen to all the bad reviews,"For the price I was a bit weary about the sound quality, but I was soon amazed by the quality. Install was a bit of a pain because my last set of speakers were professionally installed and they had cut the metal in both doors despite the fact that I purchased mounts specific to my truck which they didn't use, damn best buy. The cross overs for their size actually work as they should, just make sure you do the 30-45min break-in period, i have them hooked to a sony gtx-130 head unit which the volume goes to 32, I drove around on the highway with the volume at 27, sounded like crap in the beginning. Wow was I amazed, the longer they played the better they got, I had it cranked for atleast an hour, after that they blew my 200 pioneer 6x9's out of the water. Bass was not distorted or scratchy, highs were crystal clear. I drive a fully restored 1994 s10 blazer, and plan on highly modifying the interior so I can buy two more sets of these, put one set in the kick panels and the second set in the plastic area of the trunk, also plan on purchasing the alpine 50watt X 4 amp and an alpine double din dvd/cd touch screen head unit with an alpine type R sub in the trunk...I'll never listen to music on my onkyo surround receiver again!",Dennisjl,

Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,This desktop PC exceeds my expectations.

After scouring the web and local stores, this PC seemed to fit all my requirements better than any other in a similar price range. Bottom line: this PC exceeded my expectations. It is so quiet I do not even know it is turned on. I usually build my own PCs and this is the first time in 30+ years that I have finally selected an off-the-shelf PC. Am I ever glad I did.

The unit came with the Intel Core I7 processor and 16 GB of Ram which can handle anything I can throw at it. Also came with a AMD Radeon RX 560 graphics card which more than supports what I would use it for.I did open the case and proceed to add 2 more older hard drives. The unit came with a 1TB hard drive and the 2 extra internal hard drives gave me another 1.75 TB of memory for storing my pictures, music and digital DVDs.The unit also comes with lots of USB 3.0 ports - 4 in the front for easy access and 3 in the back. For future use, the unit also came with one USB 3.1 Type C and one USB 3.1 Type A ports.So far the unit has met all my expectations. The unit is also quiet. I also went to the Dell support site and stress tested the unit with their test applications - everything passed.This is a great computer for a person like myself who likes to collect family photos, music and digitize my store bought DVDs.

Four of the ports are in front, which makes for easy access to changing what goes into those. I also like the 16G of memory which makes working with Photoshop and Lightroom go very fast, even if I have other programs open. The design is sleek and simple.

Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,"Pretty Good Desktop for Photography, Web Apps","This is my third XPS computer in 15 years. The first was powerful but had very noisy fans, my wife who shared my office said it sounded like a plane warming up for takeoff. The second XPS was quiet, but this third iteration seems to be edging back up in noise level though not anywhere near as annoying or loud as the first.I use the XPS computer for two main tasks: Photo editing in Lightroom and Photoshop. Managing online marketing using platforms like AdWords and Analytics. This model is easily up to the task in either case. Web platforms load quickly and photos transfer between programs at an acceptable speed.I would recommend 32 GB of memory as an upgrade, and the AMD Radeon RX560 video card is about the minimum usable for the Adobe products. Photoshop working on layered files needs lots of RAM, and Lightroom is heavily dependent on video GPU / video memory for processing speed. While the RX560 meets or exceeds Adobe's suggested video memory requirements, the card seems to under perform compared to the NVIDIA card I added to the previous computer.I would recommend the XPS series for nearly anyone, but I suggest that the off the shelf models can be improved with more memory and better video cards over time. If I had one wish it would be that Dell pick a RAM memory type and stick with it. I've purchased memory upgrades for my two previous XPS computers, and none of the previous sticks will fit into the next model computer. I know, memory technology improves over time too, but it's still aggravating to have 64GB of unusable memory sticks just laying around while this new computer is starved for more GB's.",Steve,4
Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,BSOD with Dell's WIFI Drivers,"This computer was on clearance with a $125 student discount, so out the door for an insane $625... I still can't believe the price for what I got, these CPU's are $300 plus alone. I am reviewing on a $1000 price, which is still a very good deal.If you are getting the blue screen of death when updating windows, the issue may be Dell's driver they use for the onboard WIFI. Just download the newest Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 driver and you will be fine. I would recommend getting a SSD for this computer and using it for booting up your operating system. Once you use a computer with a SSD, it is hard to use a 7200 RPM HD. You can upgrade the video card pretty easily as will. The case is designed for this. However, because of people using video cards to mine, the prices are out of control. Even the RX 560 video card that is comes with is $100 plus these days. If you want to game with this machine the only video card I would upgrade to right now is a NVidia 1060 3 GB model. I am subtracting a star for dealing with WIFI driver issue, but I really think the computer is well built and has decent components.

Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,"Excellent performance, but cramped interior","I purchased the XPS 8920 when it was on sale, and it is an excellent value for the price I paid (about $800). It replaces a similar desktop (XPS 8700, 4th Gen Core i7) and has noticeably improved performance, largely because the 7th Gen Core i7 overclocks dynamically as needed. I was watching TM's performance stats and could see the CPU clock at 4.1 or 4.2. When the load diminishes, the CPU clocks down to 1.8 to 2.2. An efficient use of power.The build is solid and the computer performs well. My only cautions are two: (1) The 8920 motherboard limits the number of SATA drives to 4 (CD/DVD plus 3 hard drives, and that is one less than I was able to install in the 8700 (CD/DVD plus 4 hard drives). (2) The 8920 interior is significantly more cramped that the 8700. I was able to install two SSD drives without difficulty, but the case is not, well, roomy and is a little harder to work inside than the 8700, which was a breeze.All in all, though, the XPS 8920 was a solid investment.

It also had a habit of randomly shutting down and/or rebooting for no reason. Now I'm a computer engineer, so I know the difference between a system reboot and a random one and this was no system reboot!Back it went and I got the original iBuyPower which not only has an SSD (which ALL computers of this spec should have, but a better graphics card and comparative blazing speed - oh, and as a bonus, no unnecessary bloatware!",Guindalf,1

So I waited for only him as I heard the other salesman say to his customer when I said when your finished I can use help the people said he ca n help me as they wanted to grouse but he rudely said first come first serve, so I knew he wasn't my guy...then I watched the next salesman and I knew he was my speed, I patiently waited maybe even 35 min but he gave me all his time he was so smart and very very patient and didn't push me or rush me he is amazing.

Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,"Great specs for a good price, but...","...power supply is a little low for an XPS with a 7th gen i7. All the specs are great, and video card is more that adequate, but if the XPS series is ""built"" to allow for upgrades, why not just use a larger PS to begin with? Could use an extra HDMI port also (it only has 1), but there aren't many machines in this price range (i.e., what I paid for it) that do. My current XPS lasted 6 years before starting to slow down, I hope I get similar longevity from this one. We'll see...",jrobcra,4

Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,A good XPS replacement for 2-1/2 year old XPS,"My 2-1/2 year old Dell XPS 8700 suddenly went south (defective motherboard) and Best Buy had this XPS 8920 floor demo on sale at a very reasonable price. So I went for it. The machine is just fine. Faster than my previous model. And I can't speak highly enough about Best Buy's compassion by its technical staff for my plight, nor the wonderful support they provide. The best I've ever experienced in my long experiences as a geek. But this was a forced purchase; my older XPS 8700 was doing everything I needed or wanted it to do. So spending any money on a replacement was a drag. Thank goodness for Best Buy. They were there when I needed them. And that is the most important thing of all.",Flash,4
Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,It works fine,"Works as expected. No issues. Fast. I added a 250 gb ssd and it is quick. The RX 560 is good enough for high settings gaming. i7 is over kill for what I do, but it was on sale. i5 computers are plenty fast unless you do a lot of video editing and rendering. Case will hold 3 hard drives, there are a total of 4 sata ports inside. 1 for cd drive, 3 for hard drives. Case has standard size power supply so replacement should be easy if u want to upgrade to high end video card. If i replace power supply, get one with short cables, case is compact and no need for long cables. The usb c plug is in back, I wish it was in front, no big deal, I can run an extension hub if i need to in the future. There is 2 free memory slots if u want to add more memory. Again, that would only be necessary for intense memory programs. Computer is quiet. I am happy. Regular price of 1049.00 is too much in my opinion, but I bought it for 775.00 on sale open box. So if you can, wait for a sale. Oh, there is a M.2 slot, have not installed anything in it, but its there.",BigAl,5

Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,BSOD with Dell's WIFI Drivers,"This computer was on clearance with a $125 student discount, so out the door for an insane $625... I still can't believe the price for what I got, these CPU's are $300 plus alone. I am reviewing on a $1000 price, which is still a very good deal.If you are getting the blue screen of death when updating windows, the issue may be Dell's driver they use for the onboard WIFI. Just download the newest Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 driver and you will be fine. I would recommend getting a SSD for this computer and using it for booting up your operating system. Once you use a computer with a SSD, it is hard to use a 7200 RPM HD. You can upgrade the video card pretty easily as will. The case is designed for this. However, because of people using video cards to mine, the prices are out of control. Even the RX 560 video card that is comes with is $100 plus these days. If you want to game with this machine the only video card I would upgrade to right now is a NVidia 1060 3 GB model. I am subtracting a star for dealing with WIFI driver issue, but I really think the computer is well built and has decent components. I usually build systems, but for the price I couldn't pass it up.",discodanman45,4

Dell,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,Dell brings more power to you with the XPS.,"I was very excited to have the opportunity to get this computer, as my main desktop is 7 years old, and showing its age. I had just decided that I finally needed a replacement. This computer is a very wonderful and welcome upgrade. The tower is designed to be smaller than the standard desktop size, which makes it easier to find a place for it. I like the silver styling on the front panel very much. This computer has a tool-less design, which means that you can access the internal components without having to use any additional tools. I always wanted that feature in my next computer, because trying access the internal components on my old one was always a pain. This computer has about 11 USB ports, which is another plus because I have a ton of USB peripherals. In addition, most of the ports on the computer are the Super Speed USB 3.0 ports, which mean that I can use faster flash drives and peripherals. They even threw in a USB-C port, although it is only one.There are audio ports on both the front and the back, and this computer comes with WaveMaxx audio support, which makes external speakers sound wonderful. There is a single DVD-RW drive, so you can read and write CDs and DVDs. There is an SD card reader on the front as well. The fan system on this computer is excellent. I have not had anything happen that caused me to notice the fans kicking in in high gear.The other hardware features this computer has is a whopping 16GB of RAM, a 1 TB 7200 RPM hard drive, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wireless AC, both Intel HD Graphics 630 and an AMD Radeon RX 560 with 2GB of dedicated DDR5 RAM, and the lovely seventh generation Intel Core i7-7700 processor at 3.60 Ghz. The processor shows up as eight processors in the Device Manager, so this is one powerful computer.The modest games that I have run (osu!, DC Universe Online, Team Fortress, Minecraft) all ran without a breeze. The only issue that I had was due to me not using the correct graphics card. This computer has both integrated and dedicated graphics, and the HDMI connection that is the most obvious one is the integrated one, so I accidentally connected my monitor to the integrated graphics card by mistake. The integrated graphics port should have been covered on my unit, but it was not. So when I started gaming and had some display issues, I was surprised until I checked the manual online and realized my mistake. Still, the integrated card did run the games admirably, but nowhere near as well as the Radeon card.The computer comes with a decent keyboard and mouse. The keyboard has media shortcuts and is in a chiclet style, and the mouse actually has a built-in DPI switcher. Both are wired. The computer ships with Windows 10 Home.This computer has been a blast to use for the past few days. I have not gotten around to use all of the features, but what I have tried so far has been amazing. Also the warranty that comes with it is great. Onsite service after remote diagnosis. The service and support for the XPS line has always been great from Dell. I would definitely recommend this computer to someone who wants to be able to have a powerful machine with great features and gaming ability at a decent price.",ByM. R. Simmons,5

MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Awesome bluetooth headphones for the price!,"I have been researching Over the Ear bluetooth headphones for some time. I work in an IT environment, if I'm not on conference calls then I'm listening to music to drown out surrounding noise while I work all day at a computer. Since I have to go back and forth from call to music I typically use the ear buds that came with my phone, that have a mic.I may be the only one, but earbuds get sooo uncomfortable after hours of use. I tried a Jawbone for about a day, can't do the bluetooth in ear either..Over the ear BT headphones prices vary so much and can get very expensive on top of that I don't know that I would like them.. I bought these because they were cheap as a test run... After about 4 hours at work I LOVE them. They drown out a majority of outside noise without completely blocking all sound. (Which is good if someone is calling your attention) Music sounds WAY better than I would have imagined for the price. Of course BT headphones in general have a way to go.. these are great. So far so good on conference calls, other callers can't even tell I'm on a headset!! That's better than my earbud mic!!!If you are hesitant to buy a bluetooth over the ear headphone set, start with this one. I will likely upgrade to higher quality set eventually.... but for now I'm 100% satisfied. They are comfortable to wear all day long! Also not to mention NO WIRES!The only slight flaw is they are smaller than your typical skull candy hesh or beats over the ear set. They fit my head/ears perfectly, but if you can you should look at them in the store or google pictures of them on someone - to make sure you like the way they look.",Kstage,5
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Best bluetooth headphones i've tried...,"First, i want you all to know that i am a techno-junkie. I will try as many items as possible to know that i own the best. A couple of months back, i was in the market for bluetooth headphones to pair with my iPhone, as i travel quite a bit. Admittedly, since they are not of the in-ear variety, i had concerns that they wouldn't work well on an airplane, where it is extremely noisy. Also, keep in mind, that i tried a handful of other bluetooth headphones before settling on the AF32's. To name a few, i've tried the Jaybirds, Motorola's and Wireless Rhythm by Mikey's. Also, tried a few others. To begin with, for on-ear headphones, i couldn't believe how the cabin noise from a plane had no effect on the sound/music i was listening to. For example, even the voices in movies i was watching, was very easy to hear. Now for the shocker. The bass that came from the AF32's was shocking. It wasn't boomy at all. What i heard, was crisp bass that sounded on par with some of my go-to over the ear headphones. Pairing the headphones to my iPhone couldn't have been easier. Better yet, it charges quickly via USB and holds a charge for quite a long time. I don't know how long it's rated, but i got 7 hours on my last trip with juice to spare! If i could make just one comment that i'd like improved on future models, concerns the built-in microphone. In quiet areas, the person on the other end of the phone had no idea i was wearing headphones. With lots of noise in the background, the person i was talking to commented that they were hearing quite a bit of noise. Honestly though, i bought these for their ability with music. When i'm in a noisy environment, i simply switch back to using the iPhone's microphone. Let me tell you that it's a very small price to pay for the ability to listen to my music wirelessly, where the music sounds 100x better than i could have ever hoped. Allow me to save you time. If you are in the market for the best sounding bluetooth headphones, look no further. Don't be fooled by the reasonable price. They are truly that good! I don't know how Meelectronics did it! I will now be buying a few other AF32's as gifts for friends and colleagues. If i can leave you off with one final word, it would be ""Wow!"" Please keep in mind that i have no affiliation with the company or company representatives. Also, it is very rare that i take the time to write a review of products that i own. However, after spending some time with these, i couldn't help myself.",gemrookie,5

MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Great Headphones,My teenagers wanted the Beats headphones for Christmas. I did my research on the reviews of these headphones. For the price I could not pass them up. My teenagers love them and rave about the sound quality. They are wireless which my kids say make it so much easier with their iphones and ipods. The ear piece is a soft leather like material just like the beats headphones and fits over their ears perfectly. Great headphones and I saved over $200.00 for each pair as compared to the Beats headphones and have two happy teenagers. The warranty for two years only cost me $11.99 which was a deal as well. My only wish is that they had different colors for the headphones.,Rascalittlebit,5
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),They are pretty good!,"They have a very long battery life. I use them everyday and haven't had to recharge them. Sometimes, though, the sound drops and I don't know why since they get good reception through my car, through walls in my apartment and from pretty far away, but when my phone is in my pocket, the sound drops out, until I place my phone near the headphones. Another thing is that I bought these to work out with, but they aren't very secure on my head, but i guess it's better a little unsecured than hella tight on my head, so I exercise mindful that they can fall off. Other than that, they are pretty good!",Oaktownvinny,4

The sound quality is terrific with a deep base, almost on par with most major headphone brands. One of the only issues I've had with this product is that it slips and slides when I just turn my head a little. In order to solve this I just don't look down while I'm bending over and it stays on perfectly.

The headphones are soft and comfortable (even for laying on your ear on a pillow). Crisp highs and deep bass for such an affordable price. Bluetooth setup was hassle-free. My only complaint is the annoyingly bright, flashing light that comes on when they are searching for a source (and sometimes for a while after that). I use these primarily to watch TV or listen to music in a dark room while my girlfriend is sleeping. The flashing light occasionally creates a small strobe effect and wakes her up.

MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Headphones for the Heavy Traveler,"I purchased this several months ago with the intention of replacing another really worn-out set. I never would of guessed how much it has become integrated into my routine. As a student, I carry many books on occasion (as would be expected of one). When I use earbuds or wired headphones, they would only get in the way, and when I wanted to make a call/take a call, cables + wires would only get in my way.When I got the MEElectronics Air-fi, ALL of my problems were gone. I could carry all my books (in-hand and in-bag) without any hassle if I wanted to listen to music/make a call. Granted, I still haven't explored all the possible functions these headphones offer, they serve me very well. The microphone is more receptive than I thought - I would imagine I would need to speak up in a crowded place but that was never the case, the caller could perfectly hear as if I were speaking through the phone's microphone. The Bluetooth is also very good - 10 ft. of bluetooth was not exaggerated!The only problem I really had with these is that if you wear them too long, they heat up your ears. It's great for winter, when it's uber cold, but during the summer...you can imagine what issues can crop up.All-in-all, excellent headphones, great utility, great price.",15thpaladin,5
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),An Unbeatable Bargin,"The MEElectronic AirFi Bluetooth headphones are a product I would buy again and again. To start, you simply cannot beat the price of these headphones for the quality they provide. Second, the sound quality is excellent. I am a music junky and I have gone through dozens of headphones, but the sound quality on this pair would one of the best I've come across so far. Mind you, I never spend more than $100 for a pair of headphones. I also love that these headphones feature a built in mic, control keys, and the option to use the provided 3.5mm stereo cable to connect to any headphone compatible device. Amazing! I also, love the colors and glossy plastic, but that's purely a cosmetic thing. They seem pretty durable too, but I wouldn't go making a habit out of slamming them onto the floor.Now, the padding of the headphones makes for a pretty comfortable wearing experience, but they sometimes like to slide off my head when I look down or just headbanging to the beat. Also, I have noticed that the headphones become out of sync at times (usually I only notice this while watching Hulu or Netflix on my PC), but turning the headphones off and back on resolves this problem. Another very minor issue with these headphones is the lack of an ""L"" and/or ""R"" stamped on the either side of the headphones to indicate the proper placement of the speakers over your ears. Though I figured that the built in mic should point forward, which would mean the side with the buttons should be placed over your right ear.All-in-all I am extremely happy with these headphones and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a set of Bluetooth headphones that fit a smaller budget.",SamPG,5
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Great headphones for the price,"These headphones are a great value. They have very good sound.

There is no reason to spend 300 bucks for headphones when you can buy these for 70 like I did, they are EASILY worth double what they cost. The blutooth range is rated at 30 feet but that is an underatatement. I work in a machine shop and can leave my iPhone or iPad in my toolbox and walk behind a sheetmetal wall that is 50 feet away and they still dont skip! They only skip when I am behind that wall AND behind a machine! The only problem I had was the FIRST time I tried to pair them, I wasnt holding the button down long enough, beware of that and read the instructions better than I did and you will be fine.",BigDaddyRT,5

It connects (Blue Tooth) easily and sounds great. Friends report that the nearly invisible mic sounds as clear as when I am using a boom. It performs on a par with much more expensive headsets.My only issue is with the ""feel"" of the headset. The set is of constrained design due to being foldable. When wearing them, they feel a bit awkward to me because of the way they need to be arranged on my head. When I put them on, I find myself a bit distracted as they feel awkward. However, this passes quickly and I have worn them for communications that have lasted up to two hours without issue.",DesertFriar,4

I assume she uses it for phone conversations too, and hasn't told be of any problems.Probably not the headphones of choice for an audiophile, but for a kid who tends to lose or break her electronics, this is a good value for the money -- and the sound is plenty good enough for what she listens to.",elf13,4

MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Simple and Excellent Sound,"Initially bought these for gaming so that I could chat with friends (on Ventrillo) and not have that cable drooping over my arms. Didn't work out. But the more I researched I found that it wasn't the headphones fault, it was Bluetooth in general. Bluetooth won't process a microphone in mono and stereo audio at the same time. The result is using your device in pure mono. Not so great. Again, not the headsets fault. So with this in mind, I don't game with the device using Bluetooth, I use my other wired gaming headset.All that aside, I love this headset. It was only $59, and I use it daily. I use it for my Galaxy Note 8, PC, Motorola Droid Razr Maxx when I'm not home, and at the gym.The fit is just right for my head, and I like how it's very light. I don't feel like I have a giant headset on that can come flying off If I move my head to quickly.The sound is superb, I was extremely surprised how good the bass was. I typically listen to Hip Hop and House music, so that was key for me. I bought these online, so I was worried they would not meet my needs. But they did.The Bluetooth connection is decent. Although, my other headsets have not been any better. I imagine this is probably related to the fact that my entire house is wireless. My wife and two kids use tablets daily, their gaming consoles are wireless, in addition to their laptops and my wifes PC. That combined with our wireless Smart TV's, and wireless stereos in the bathrooms... we have alot of RF floating around in the house. I'll cut this a break. I can typically walk about 30' away before it starts to break up. Although, I think this is the maximum that the FCC will allow, so no heartache there.The device pairs quite easily, and I use it on several devices, so I don't have any complaints in this department.Battery life is actually really good. I can go 3 days or so using it for about 4 hours a day. I don't let them sit on the charger when not in use, because that is probably bad for any device. When I go to charge them, the connect is bad, so I have to let the headphones sit at an angle on top of the connector so that it gets a good connection and charges. I'm sure it's the cable and not the headset, as the headset comes with a wired cable so that you can use this headset in wired mode.Using the headset in wired mode is a really nice feature, as if I'm low on charge I don't have to seek out a new headset.The headset also folds up for easy storing, and they provide a nice little felt bag in case you need to pack these up for traveling. Nice touch if you ask me.That's my review, hope this helps somebody out.I highly recommend these if you're looking for a headset that is cheap and really meets these primary needs:Great SoundEasy to Pair to multiple devicesLong life and charges using a USB plugFolds up for easy packingComfortable fit",DangerZoneDweller,5

MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Very useful for price I paid,Because the price was great (on e day sale online) I felt there was little to lose considering the higher price of so many other earphones with or without blue tooth. They look fine in color blue and the sound is so much better than the wired headsets that can be annoying at the gym. I would recommend this unit. I also researched reviews before I placed the order.,Juljr,4
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Works as advertised,"So far these headphones have been working well. Easy set up and connected to multiple devices without issue (one at a time). They stay on when running and exercising. The battery life is suitable. The only issue I have is they are sweat sponges. No odor issues yet but I imagine they will come with time, and no way that I can see of cleaning them, or repairing IF sweat causes damage. It is enough for me, but some may not like the lower volume limit. I like them and think the price was right for the product (purchased as deal of the day).",JulieW,4

I use them around the house to listen to audio books and podcasts so I do not disturb others and the freedom of going wireless is great!",gobot16,4
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Great sound for any wireless use,"After great experiences with other MEE Audio products, I bought my son (11 years old) the Runaway bluetooth headphones to replace his Koss headphones that only lasted a few months (internal solder joints broke). I've never even owned a pair of bluetooth headphones myself, so I figured that I could get some use out of these too (which I have). ;) My thought was that wireless would be the best way to avoid any audio problems related to wiring, which I speculate is the failure point of the majority of earbuds and headphones.The Runaways have not disappointed in the slightest, and I could not be more pleased. They simply sound GREAT. Construction is study plastic, and the wear is comfortable, adjustable, with easy-to-control bluetooth functions. The headphones collapse for storage, within a nice included felt bag. An included stout 3.5mm cable can be used if desired, perhaps when the battery is running low for bluetooth function.I am not an audiophile, but I'm a music lover and have spent several years as a stage musician at a church with 7,000 - 9,000 congregants... so I have a decent amount of experience and appreciation for musical detail and great audio.If you want to dabble in the bluetooth headphone market for a great product that won't break the bank... these Runaways are for you!",Scott,5
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Great lightweight bluetooth headphones,"These headphones are very light and comfortable to wear for several hours (though your ears might get a bit sweaty on hot days). It's easy to pair the bluetooth and it comes with its own audio cable if you forget to charge it or if you prefer wired headphones. The sound quality is great for music and phone calls! I wouldn't really wear these to work out, other than maybe running, because there isn't anything that holds them onto your ears, other than gravity, so they might slip off if you're bending over a lot. My biggest concern with these was maybe losing the proprietary charging cable, but when I ended up doing just that, I found replacements pretty quickly, both on amazon and their website.",AG106,5
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),"Good sound, easily used",I purchased these headphones from the BestBuy Canada website and am very satisfied with their performance and ease-of-use. I have been using them for ten months and they still perform flawlessly. Easy to pair with more than one device. Listen to movie audio on my laptop and take and make calls on my phone at the same time. Sound quality is good for my purposes. My only complaint is that they need to be placed on the head just right or they will fall off if I dip my chin just a little bit.,drlambert,4
MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),Good headphone with off-bt connection,"This is my third pair of BT headphone/headset that I've owned (Cardo S2, LG Tone). All 3 pairs of headphone are different type of wear so it is hard to compare how comfortable it is. That said this headphone/headset is remarkably light. I understand why some people commented that their ear get sweaty as my ear definitely felt hotter with the headphone on. Still I have this headphone on during my 90 minutes commute and it was comfortable enough.In terms of audio quality, not being an audiophile, I am happy with the sound. I can hear the lyrics & melody clearly and the sound is comparable to the other BT headphones that I've owned. The call quality was clear and both myself and the caller have no problem hearing each other. The only complaint that I have is that occasionally while on BT, I would get a hiccup during a song where it would pause for a second. I suppose that is an inherent problem with BT and signal interference but I did not have that problem with my other BT headphones.The biggest selling point for me is the fact that I can connect the included 3.5mm cable to make the headset a wired headphone. It has always been a gripe to me that you would spend some money on a BT headphone that will become useless once the rechargeable battery is dead. Now that is no longer an issue. The only thing is that the included cable will not allow you to use the mic on the headphone to make calls. However...MEElectronics sells a replacement 3.5mm cable that includes an in-line remote with microphone in case you want to use this headphone as a wired headset also.",xc4628,4

After my Boyfriend got a pair of wireless Beats by Dre headphones I got sucked into the convenance of not being tied down by a cord.

They are comfortable, I wear them for hours at a time, and have multiple cartilage piercings, and have no problems. My only complaint is that some of the plastic that helps hold the head phones open, broke about 2 months after I got them, but this does not significantly impair the use of the product. I have had the headphones for 2 years now and they still work great. I ussually have to charge them once a week. I probably use them about 18 hours a week.",Reb25,4

I figured this would be a way to do that. Unfortunately, the TV would need an adapter for bluetooth, and for whatever reason, Sony made their bluetooth audio only support in-game chat, so it won't work for Hulu. Not the headphones fault, but something I didn't think to check beforehand, and the product description kinda suggests it should work for.

They are on-ear, but the cushion is nice and soft. I can wear them for longer extended periods and my ears don't get irritated. Plus they are smaller and more light-weight than most over the ear almost like they are not there. Noise cancelling is good as I wear them at work and can barely hear nearby conversations. I have yet to have any issues with the Bluetooth pairing on iDevices, Android, or computers, with the exception of a Sony PS4. (Unfortunately, Sony only accepts a very limited, proprietary Sony headphones for their device.) These headphones give you built in voice feedback telling you ""Power on"", or ""Power off"", ""Device connected"", ""Battery high/low"", etc.. Additionally you can control some playback functions, volume, and they can act as a wireless phone headset. They come with an optional audio cord, a charging cable, and a pouch to carry it all in.

Since then, I have used them in all kinds of situations and find that they work excellently everywhere, without skipping. I have used them on long walks, on my commute through NYC's subway system, and at home. Mostly pros in the headphone. The only con (and this is true of all wireless headphones) is that the bass is not as deep or booming as on a wired headphone.Pros - instant connection with my various Bluetooth devices good battery life no skipping while walking or in the gym clear music streaming great comfort and fit good sound isolation - not active noise cancelation, but this sound isolation enables one to listen to music or talks at volumes that are not too high even in a NYC subway while listening to music, even people standing next to you cannot overhear it (which is a HUGE thing for me, as I detest having to listen to other people's screeching music while commuting) controls for volume, skipping tracks and pairing on the headphones are easy to use and logically placed.I would have liked the ability to turn my iPod or iPad on or off from the headset itself, but maybe that is not technologically feasible, I don't know.Highly recommend these headphones for purchase.",Yogi D,

MEE audio,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),"Short Answer, I Love these!","I'm very happy with this purchase.Background, I use these on my daily commute. 40 minute walk through the hills of San Francisco. Windy, check. Wanted for both listening to music/podcasts as well as making phone calls. Primarily using with an android phone.I was worried about a couple things when I bought these: - Read peoples ears got sweaty - Had some mixed reviews for phone calls - Some said they didn't stay on head extremely wellPassed those, I had read all positives on these for the price-point. And in my opinion, none of these were an issue for me. They stay on my head just fine. I've even jogged with them and they maintained their position. Ears get a little sweaty on really sunny days. If you live in a hot climate, have the sun pounding on you while using -- you may want to consider that. For me here in SF, not an issue at all. Even on sunny days, with a cool breeze, no issue whatsoever. Phone calls have been wonderful as well. Was on a busy street earlier, they could still hear me loud and clear. So much so that I was happily surprised. I thought for sure with the wind ripping past, people honking etc, there's no way this is going to be a good experience. I was so wrong.First impressions:- They were a little smaller/thinner than I was expecting. Not sure why, they look jsut as they do in the image. But to my delight, still fit me beautifully.- Because it's all plastic, it doesn't look quite as cool as the new monster phones, but then again they are not 300 and they are sooo light because of it. I could literally wear these all day without really noticing.- Actually, they look pretty cool.- Bluetooth is painless, easily connected to pc and phone.- The sound quality is great.Read more",M.

But it's good to know it works and that it works well.Also, I have listened to my co-workers Wireless BT Headset from Dre Beats, and I was totally knocked for a loop when a 50-75 dollar headset sound just as good, if not better then a 299.99 headset! Also, these headphones are so much lighter and are way more comfortable then the Dre Beats ones. I was actually contemplating on getting the BT Dre Beats, but thankfully I got a rare opportunity to listen to and compare them with what I already have (these and the Sony's). Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't dish out the cashola for the Dre Beats ones.Another advantage this set has is that you can use it wirelessly or with a wire (which is included).I give this device a 4 out of 5 because the flaws are that it can make your ears sweat a little bit and that the charging cord is unique in that you have to plug the cord into your earphone jack of the headphones, thus preventing you from using them while they charge.Hope this helps. But for now, this is the least expensive to quality sound reproduction headset ratio you are going to find on the market.",Jouten Zennousha,

Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't dish out the cashola for the Dre Beats ones.Another advantage this set has is that you can use it wirelessly or with a wire (which is included).I give this device a 4 out of 5 because the flaws are that it can make your ears sweat a little bit and that the charging cord is unique in that you have to plug the cord into your earphone jack of the headphones, thus preventing you from using them while they charge.Hope this helps. But for now, this is the least expensive to quality sound reproduction headset ratio you are going to find on the market.",Mecha Aslan,

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),Five Stars for its Picture Quality Price/Performance Ratio,"I made a side-by-side comparison with five other 50-inch-class TVs utilizing different LED/LCD/backlighting combinations. All were in the same price range. This model utilizes LED-backlit LCDs. I could visualize (as promised) better contrast and brightness, greater color range, more rapid response to changes in scene and more accurate image rendering. I did disable the Eco Sensor option and increased the judder control. The mobile-to-tv mirroring and wi-fi connection were simple to set-up and both performed well for streaming content locally and from the cloud, much better faster than my 2015 40-inch Samsung. The sound is perhaps adequate in a small room, but I was much happier when I plugged in a 250 Yamaha soundbar. It matched-up automatically with the TV's Dolby DTS signals. Mounting the TV to my swivel/stand and the soundbar to the TV was straight-forward. My only nit is that all of these 40-50 inch TVs have just two 2 HDMI inputs, ugh! That said, for less than 500 I got a TV that compared favorably with other 50-inch TVs costing 100-200 more.",ByGoose,5

Great price, but not worth it. Scared to keep it with issues like this within a week. My other Samsung tv in my living room has none of these issues and it’s about 2-3 years old. Also, the SmartHub apps run really slow. May pay the difference and get the 4K or switch out of the brand altogether. Very disappointing, Samsung.",Jennifer,1

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),Green people,"Since when did people start looking green Maybe, I just have a lemon. However, no matter how much I adjust the tint people's faces look a tinge green, and it's unevenly distributed. For example, the upper right side of a face can look natural while the bottom left looks green, and vice versa, or there are patches of green around one eye, one cheek, and around the mouth and half the side of a chin, and sometimes there's half a green nose. It's just annoying.The sound is ok, sometimes it sounds distorted. I wish it had surround sound.I would have liked the Guide button on the remote instead of having to press the home button on the remote and then pressing the arrow button on the remote to scroll and search for the guide.I like the Smart Hub's white interface. Smart Hub is fast, and I like how the apps display where I've been.

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),Nice tv but somewhat misleading information on the capabilities .,I just ordered this tv and unless I am doing something wrong I cannot access the smarthub inthe same manner that I see other people using it on videos . I am under the impression that the 5 Series tv I ordered (UN32M5300AFXZA) has an older version of Smarthub and although I did a factory reset of the tv my issue was not resolved. I see people accessing their Smarthub simply by pressing a button on their remote but my remote doesn't have a Smarthub buttom and I've downloaded an app that has it but I cannot access it . Clearly this is not the Samsung tv that comes with Google Play that would make this so much better and user friendly.

I know the password, confirmed it many times. After calling customer service, they asked if my password had any unique characters (it does) and they told me the TV will not allow for special characters in a password to be able to connect. This is a huge inconvenience (going to have to change every device in my house for this TV), not too mention a matter of security (the more random numbers and characters the better). I am shocked that Samsung knows this and won't make any kind of change.

I'm VERY familiar with all the Samsung products, & had no hesitation of what I wanted to buy, but more a simple decision on the size...my Bro had no need for 4K, but we did compare the HD vision of the Samsung products to the 32-36"" variants, & decided on the 40"" HD...PIC is RAZOR, & the SMART addition to the HD was something the Bro had no idea about, & yet, has been tickled pink since he received his HD! Easy setup...easy use of remote...and overall a VERY COOL deal from Best Buy...as always!!!",Chipita,5

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),Not bad but has some WiFi issues,"Im reviewing this as a bedroom TV to watch cable and netflix on. I have not gamed on it. Picture is pretty good just dont expect really inky blacks because its an LED not an OLED. There are a lot of picture adjustment options but its decent right out of the box. Speakers are fine and it was easy to mount. So my only grip with this TV is how long it takes to pick up a WiFi signal when you turn it on. When you turn it off, it goes into a sleep mode of sorts so that you can choose to have it power on with your last used app up and ready to go. Problem is, sometimes when you turn it and and try to start playing internet content right away, it will say you have no internet connection. Reason being sometimes it just takes a while to re-connect to your WiFi after being turned off. So the only remedy to this is to just wait until it picks up the signal. My ritual at night is I turn it on, then I brush my teeth so when I come back I know it will be connected and ready to go. I used to try to just turn it on and go right into watching netflix but then it would say no internet connection and ask me if I wanted to troubleshoot. I am on the latest firmware update also. This is your warning.",ByPat Dorsman,3

It has great color and I have had no issues with it since I purchased it. The only thing that was a little difficult was setting up the WiFi and the updates that needed to be completes before I could use it. It did take awhile and my router kept booting me off because the TV's WiFi kept buffering. Once I got passed that point, it was all smooth sailing.

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),"Great product, Great price, Great purchase!","This is my first time purchasing a Samsung television, and I am extremely pleased with it! It is a perfect television for watching sporting events and entertaining company. If you are looking for a smart television for a low price and great quality I definitely recommend this Samsung 50-inch LED SmartTv.When receiving this product the shipping was fast and was packaged well. The set-up was a simple and quick process. It took me about ten minutes to get it all set up. The accessibility of this television is one of its best qualities. It easily connects to Wi-Fi for the use of Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and searching the web. It is also equipped with two HDMI outlets, which are very convenient. I found the smart television features to be quite easy to navigate.It has come in extremely useful when having company over for parties, because it is great for watching and listening to music videos. The sound quality of the speakers is excellent. No need for expensive portable speakers we just listen to it off the television! The LED lighting makes the brightness and color fantastic for a great overall picture quality. The clear picture is wonderful for watching football games and hosting movie nights.I believe the price is great for the value that you receive. Compared to most smart televisions this Samsung has excellent quality and is quite affordable. I would suggest this television for college students like myself who are looking for a nice television for a relatively low price. It is a perfect television for my roommates and me, and I can still afford my Ramen noodles.The only negative comment I would have about this purchase is the television stand. It has a two-leg base, so it does not seem as sturdy as what is shown in the advertisement. I saw this to only be a minor inconvenience that would not deter me from recommending this product. I would suggest using a wall mounting instead. With this being my first experience with Samsung, I will definitely be using their products in the future. I think this is a perfect television for young adults on a budget. The accessibility, quality, and price won this television a five star rating from me. Overall this was a great purchase, and I would highly recommend this product. It made a great addition to my living room!",ByHaley Bommersbach,5

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),Extreamly Unhappy Consumer!!!!!,"I'm so disappointed in this Samsung TV. I just got it today and set it up only to find out the Smart Hub where all the apps are accessed does not work. I called Samsung customer service about the issue and I was told by a representative that this particular model is faulty where users try to access the Smart Hub and nothing happens. The rep then proceeded to tell me that it is a known issue and their engineers are working on fixing it. So I asked how long the issue was known and the rep said for a week. He told me I can either return the TV to Amazon for a refund or wait until the engineers come up with a solution. So I asked him, why Amazon did not pull this particular model from their inventory and he said he could not comment on that. So I have concluded that either Amazon knew about the issue and still sold the product as advertised even though the smart features are missing (this is considered false advertising and illegal) or they didn't know and the fault lies with Samsung soley. On top of all of that The rep could not give me a time frame for when the issue would be fixed and there is a real possibility it can't be fixed. So now I have this basic tv that does none of the things I purchased it for. Lets just say I'm livid. Please people, save yourself the time, money, and frustration and do not buy this model!!",ByMs. Mom,1

The stand works well and the assembly was fairly easy. It is a pretty solid assembly with the 55 TV. I have no concerns about it tipping but I would strap it to the wall if there were children in the home. The price point is great. The kit included several different bolts and washers to attach the mount to nearly any type of TV. I would give it 5 stars however, I had to use different bolts and washers with the mount. The TV wobbled and shook with the bolts that were included with the kit. I recommend that if you are moving from a wall mount to table top that you use your old wall mount bolts.",ByLouise Dorn,5

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),Overall a Good TV,"I am little concerned about the picture when I am viewing regular TV. It seems very cloudy, hazy on the screen. I have another TV in my house that has a great picture on it and coloring. I have done some research and it appears there is a fix to this, but I am not sure what that would be. It is weird that it can switch between what appears to be a normal and nice picture to this cloudy, hazy picture within a movie/show that I am watching. It sometimes appears to make some of the items on the screen translucent. I have changed between the different options for the picture output and it still happens. It is strange and a little concerning to me. I am trying to determine if I should return the TV and pick out another one. There should be a maybe option for whether or not you would recommend the TV. I selected yes, but really would say maybe. If the issue can be resolved without returning the TV, then I would say YES.",EAGNOLA,4

Samsung,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),"Good TV, minor issues with built-in Wi-Fi menus","Good price for a 50-inch TV. Bright, vibrant colors, and clear display. Exactly the high quality you'd expect from Samsung electronics.My only (minor) issues:- Every time I turn TV on (or it gets automatically turned on because a connected HDMI device is activated, cool feature btw), there is this annoying pop-up menu for selecting a built-in TV app or something. I never use this, and I either have to wait for the menu to disappear after several seconds or manually close the menu myself by pressing RETURN on the remote. I'd rather this menu never pop up at all.- The TV has built-in Wi-Fi (and apps), which is nice, but during Wi-Fi setup, there is a completely irrational password length limit that makes no sense whatsoever. My Wi-Fi network has a long password (over 32 characters, don't ask), and I can't connect to it on this TV because the password entry field has a hard limit for the length of characters you can type. I dunno the exact limit, but it's obviously less than 32 characters. Why this is a thing bamboozles me as they should have just followed the specification on what the maximum password length is for Wi-Fi connections, but whatever I don't use my TV for Wi-Fi anyway, so it's a minor issue (I have a connected Fire TV for streaming, and at least THAT device allows for 32 length Wi-Fi network passwords).",ByJoseph G.

I am disheartened to see the review for the 32 Samsung that indicates smart function problems. I would like to buy a Samsung, as I currently have 3-Models that work well. I would like to know that they have repaired the Smart TV problem before committing to their 2017 32 model. Is there any way to find out or be alerted that the the problem has been fixed I have the 2015 32 model with Apple TV, Roku outboard devices. It too does not function as advertised by the manufacturer. But the picture is exceptional. It seems that Samsung has not put their technology to bare on this problem, though they continue to promote the feature.

Even when the TVs were not sorted by brand, I still found myself visually drawn to this model. Its very clear and seemed to be brighter than the other models to me.The dimensions are great, there is very little wasted space, and the TV is light enough to easily move. Wall Mounting was a simple task.The SMART TV interface is well implemented and initial configuration was a breeze.I have three complaints about it though which are why I only give 4 stars:1. The power cord and the input ports are on opposite sides of the TV. This makes it that much harder to keep the cords out of the way.2. The power cord was too short for a TV intended to be wall mounted. It limited where the TV could be placed (so we bought a longer cord)3. For a while Netflix was unable to access the internet even though the TV could still download updates. This was fixed by redoing the network settings and reconnecting to Netflix. Based on my research, it sounds like this happens fairly regularly when the software is updated.Overall I am EXTREMELY happy with the TV and expect I'll buy yet another Samsung TV when I eventually replace this one.",ByJ.R.

The speakers sound noticeably better than my last set, have really good specs for frequency response and distortion levels, comes with a huge subwoofer, and can handle enough watts to meet my expectations for the need to listen music at least as loud as concert volume. I have not watched movies using surround sound yet, but I paired the speakers with a new Sony amp STR=DH540 (also $129) and plugged in a new Chromecast, and now once again I can play music from my computer, only this time it sounds even better and I'm expecting it to last and use it for home theater as well.",JSweet777,5

Along with it I gave him an older 5.1 Sony receiver (STR-DE845) to make up his first surround system. I was actually quite impressed with this set up in a medium sized room. The sound from the center and sattelites was detailed, and very clear. The 8"" sub had no problem pumping out plenty of LFE for the room.

Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"It took me weeks of research before I purchased this product. I liked the idea of the Yamaha name, but was concerned the quality would be less than optimal because the price was so low. While I am not an audiophile I like to have the best my limited money can buy. The 6 Ohm rating was a big hiccup for me as well, as 8 ohm is what all receiver ratings are calculated on. But after looking closely at the manual for my receiver I found it supported 6-16 Ohm speakers. So we were good there. My receiver, a Pioneer VSK-519 showed up before my speakers so I hooked it up to some Sony book shelf speakers to test it out. When the Yamaha speakers came I was only able to hook up three of the five speakers with the included speaker wire, so I used the Sony's as R and L. The Sony's put out noticeably more sound than the Yamaha's which was at first concerning to me. And once I got them out of the way I had to turn the receiver up higher to get the same output. I watch movies right around 50-52 when with the Sony speakers, I was quite happy at 40. I suspect this is related to the 82 db rating (and the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5). But turning the Amp up a little higher is not a big deal and the Receiver has been very happy in it's low ventilation area, and is in no danger of overheating.I also upgraded my speaker wire to 16 gauge and have not noticed a difference.Other thoughts, even though the Sub is a 100W amp, it only produces 50W of output, just like it says on the Manufacture site. So Amazon was a little misleading there. No big deal, because the Sub is quite adequate in my 1200 sqft house, it is everywhere, my poor wife.My Brother who spent well over 1000 on his surround sound (Mine: 100.Read more",F. Wheeler,4

Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"It took me weeks of research before I purchased this product. I liked the idea of the Yamaha name, but was concerned the quality would be less than optimal because the price was so low. While I am not an audiophile I like to have the best my limited money can buy. The 6 Ohm rating was a big hiccup for me as well, as 8 ohm is what all receiver ratings are calculated on. But after looking closely at the manual for my receiver I found it supported 6-16 Ohm speakers. So we were good there. My receiver, a Pioneer VSK-519 showed up before my speakers so I hooked it up to some Sony book shelf speakers to test it out. When the Yamaha speakers came I was only able to hook up three of the five speakers with the included speaker wire, so I used the Sony's as R and L. The Sony's put out noticeably more sound than the Yamaha's which was at first concerning to me. And once I got them out of the way I had to turn the receiver up higher to get the same output. I watch movies right around 50-52 when with the Sony speakers, I was quite happy at 40. I suspect this is related to the 82 db rating (and the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5). But turning the Amp up a little higher is not a big deal and the Receiver has been very happy in it's low ventilation area, and is in no danger of overheating.I also upgraded my speaker wire to 16 gauge and have not noticed a difference.Other thoughts, even though the Sub is a 100W amp, it only produces 50W of output, just like it says on the Manufacture site.

The powered subwoofer is excellent. The center speaker is larger than most and gives great sound. THe system comes with wire but I suggest ordering 16 AWG.

Yamaha,NS-SP1800BL 5.1-Channel Home Theater System (Black),"good speakers, cheap price","These speakers are a great value at around 100 dollars. They work great and sound amazing for small speakers. The sub is has its own volume control and I have yet to turn it past a quarter of the way up because the thumping, clear base shakes the house fairly well. The only issues with this system are minor. First the speaker wire is only about a 24 gauge, which for small rooms is perfectly fine. On a positive note there is 100ft of this wire included. The only other minor problem is they are 6 ohm speakers. Most receivers will have an option for running this so it's a fairly simple fix. So this is a perfect set for people on a budget but in want of great surround sound for a small to medium sized room. These would even work well in a large room as long as you aren't trying to blast the speaker volume loud enough to wake the neighbors.",Kevin P. Mahar,

Except for broken center channel and flimsy cable, works fine...","Using this with a Sony BD player and Onkyo 5.1 amp linked via coax audio TV via HDMI. After all settings were completed, the action and big explosions sounded great. If you listen to movies using TV speakers, you don't know what you're missing.br /br /BUT I couldn't hear dialog. Checked all settings, and searched online forums. I tried to boost the dB for the center but still couldn't hear.

Then I used the test tone from the amp to find out the center channel speaker doesn't work.

Bose,Acoustimass 6 Series V Home Theater Speaker System (Black),amazing sound system,"I picked up one of these units in a bundle from a local warehouse club and I am blown away by the clarity and the quality of the sound that this system produces. The speakers are small and low profile but really pack a punch, and the speaker cable that comes with them is very high quality and heavy gauge, not the thin flimsy stuff you get from you home theater in a box brands. Setup is pretty straight forward although I will admit this is my first time working with a high end sound system that requires its own independent receiver. I bought this unit package with a Yamaha receiver which also came with the Bose Bluetooth adapter. It probably took me an hour or so to get everything set up all the wires run and make all the connections properly. And then took me about an hour to figure out how to use the receiver, I am NOT an AV expert admittedly, but I did figure it out and it is really quite an impressive system. The quality of the Bose system is second to none, at least at this price point. You can always spend more for higher end components but its starts getting to the point that there are diminishing returns financially. This is a great system for a larger area, or a small one it's very good and the setup is not very difficult.",Tebowned,

Logitech software makes it easy to set DPI settings, customize buttons, and colors. There's just enough buttons to have a good mix of utility without becoming overwhelming. The only thing I would like to see how of this mouse is Logitech's Hyper-Fast scroll wheel.

Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,Nice Marine Stereo!,"Put this unit in my 27 bowrider replacing an older Sony unit. The unit is much smaller in depth due to the lack of the CD player. It has a wiring harness with all the leads marked by color coding for what position (front/back-left/right) and polarity. I can see the display just fine in the sunlight so no problem there. I paired it with 4 Infinity marine speakers and the DSXM55BT drives them well. Cranked up I can here the music while underway. The Bluetooth connects well with no issue and radio stations tune in clear. Overall, I feel this is a real nice unit for the money, installed easily, manual is straight forward and once you get the hang of the controls/menu it's fairly intuitive. My only complaint is when I shut the batteries off on the boat the unit loses its presets, but it's fairly quick to re-memorize them with the 6 preset buttons and that is not the fault of the unit. I would have no problem recommending this unit and it does have pre-outs for an amp if needed to expand or add a bass speaker.",ByScott,5

Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,Radio cycles on and off frequently when in use,Installed this new radio into my crownline and immediately saw a problem as it would turn itself on and off every minute or two. Confirmed with a voltage meter that it is getting a constant 12 volts but it you connect to blur tooth or plug in another device to the boat it causes the radio to fail. Acquired at Frys who would not replace the radio. I believe it may have a circuit that cuts off power if voltage move just a 10th of a volt. Poor design as other brands have never shown this problem.,ByAmazon Customer,1

Her 2002 Chrysler had a thin, tiny sounding stock radio. Tried different eq settings to no avail. Read some reviews and noticed this Sony had 5 stars. It's a marine radio designed for a boat that probably doesn't have a hard roof. I figured if it sounds good in the great outdoors, it'll sound better with some walls to bounce off of. It does! My daughter loves it. It has all the features she wanted to be able to play her music. The sound is full and gets better as it's cranked. I appreciate BestBuy's policy of uninstalling it for free as it will easily outlive my daughter's Chrysler and then be moved to a different vehicle.

Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,Face Plate ruined my experience. Would have gave 5 if things would have worked,"I bought this unit for my 2006 HD Road Glide as the original HD unit was hard to hear and the display went dark so could not see what adjustments I was making. After 3 days of working in some of the muggiest weather and going back and forth 20 miles one way to get tools clips and other crap as I have never installed a stereo on a bike before or stripped my bike down quite as far as this but wanted to make sure everything was as professional looking as possible. Also was really looking forward to thumb controlled Bluetooth music rather than aux plugin with no easy way to select music. So I get all finished up today and the plunkin faceplate does not catch (stuck on ejection of the faceplate). I did get it to finally catch and I really loved the sound and the bluetooth hookup made me a little giddy. Took it out for a spin and almost lost the faceplate on the very first bump. This unit arrived this way and I do not know if the problem is in the faceplate or the receiver as nothing looks broken off. This sucks as the whole grand total came out to 400.00 for the stereo, thumb control retainer and installation conversion kit (Dash and wire harness). So now I have to call to try and have this resolved.",ByAmazon Customer,2

Customers just need FM radio and Bluetooth (give me a display and two simple buttons!), but they cram 100 tiny buttons on the unit, requiring you to press several (in random sequence, it seems) to switch inputs. The display and layout on all of these after market car/boat units has not advanced much from the units of the 90s (pixel-ly, cheesy techno looking, with weird abbreviations for all the messages it tries to display).

Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,Does NOT have wired remote support.,"Easy to install and easy to use. Looks good, reads music off of a USB drive as advertised, and bluetooth setup to my phone was a snap. FM reception is fine, and RDS works great, and the price is fair. Be aware that the remote that comes with it is a small handheld IR thing, not RF, and needs to have line of sight to the faceplate to work. It won't work If your radio is mounted below deck or in a box.I liked this product enough in the first week to try and buy the RM-X11M wired accessory remote that is called out in the manual, since the IR remote won't work for me from the helm. Unfortunately, Sony has discontinued the RM-X11M remote, and it is no longer available for purchase! Sony support says that they no longer produce ANY wired remote that works with this head unit, and I've not managed to find any 3rd party remote that will work.So.. its a nice unit as long as you don't buy it expecting to use the wired remote that the documentation claims is available. I'm very disappointed that Sony would discontinue the remote for a radio that they produced less than a year ago!",ByJeff J,3
Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,Two brand new units fail in two month period: DON'T BUY,"UPDATE ... Bottom Line Up Front: DON'T BUY SONY MARINE PRODUCTS. Corrosion formed over two weeks on a brand new unit ... enough corrosion to void the manufactures warranty. I can only assume that the advertising on the anti-corrosion coating is EXTREMELY exaggerated or that this is a manufacturing defect (my contention with them). After this experience, I will not even CONSIDER a Sony marine ANYTHING. It is NOT manufactured correctly to handle use on water.This radio was a disappointment for a very specific reason: It failed within a month of first usage. Even worse, the warranty REPLACEMENT unit failed less than a month after installing it. The first unit's failure was the inability to leave demo mode, i.e. making it useless. The second unit's failure was more spectacular ... a blown fuse on the water leaving a nice toxic smoke behind the control panel. This was followed by the blowing of a replacement fuse back on shore when power was reapplied. Obviously, something in the unit has a major short -- the second fuse blew immediately, produced some arcing, and a nice puff of toxic smoke!Kudos to Sony on the first replacement process. No so good on this second replacement. At least it's under warranty (and I bought an Amazon extended warranty, too).When it worked, the sound was good with plenty of volume without distortion. Bluetooth with an iPhone worked fine but it was slightly cumbersome getting them paired. It was easy to read in the bright sunlight and fairly easy to operate. Tuning FM could be a challenge but once I got it going, it wasn't that difficult.If I were to do this over, I would NOT buy this radio. Instead, I would spend the additional money on a Sonichub 2 to work with my Lowrance unit and put a plate over the hole in my boat's dash.",ByKFDB,1

Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,Easy install in my jeep,"Easy install in my jeep, had no issues connecting my XM tuner. I now have XM in my '79 CJ and a much better radio than before. I never have a top on and don't mind driving in the rain. This deck had been rained on hard and doesn't have a single issue. Well worth the money even if you put it in a vehicle that it won't get wet in.I needed something with Bluetooth because it's impossible to hear my phone (and most times feel it) ring when i take the jeep out. This wouldn't be an issue except my job requires that I am available 24/7. With that said the Bluetooth works fine at slow speeds (this had me pleasantly surprised) but is impossible to speak at highway speeds, I knew this would happen and only wanted something to let me know a call was coming in, which out does very well.",ByScott,5
Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,We'll see if the second one is any better than the first.,"This unit is just OK. I installed it into the fairing of my motorcycle, and within the first 200 miles, it started exhibiting strange behavior that worsened. It appears that the connection between the removable face plate and the base unit. It totally died within about 400 miles. Amazon support was ridiculously awesome, however. I called at 10pm on a Saturday night and they had a replacement unit at my door at 4pm on Sunday. So far my experience with the new one has been pretty good, with the exception of one time that the volume just suddenly dropped from 35 to about 4, and another time that I looked at it and the display was back in demo mode. I suspect that I will have to make use of the 3 year replacement warranty that I purchased before it's all said and done, but we'll see.",ByDavid B Shuck,3

Sony,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,"Would be great, but one big issue.","I installed this on my '09 Harley Street Glide. This is my second Sony marine radio, the first lasted about 3 years. This newer model is easier for me to use because the buttons are larger. It's not easy pushing tiny buttons while riding with gloves. I also have a module that allows me to control some functions using the bike's hand grip controls, and I have a Sirius/XM unit attached. It sounds decent and looks good, especially at night with the blue lights. The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is that on occasion, the volume changes on it's own. It will randomly raise all the way up to 50 (full volume), other times it will drop down very low. I can't figure out why it happens, but at least it doesn't happen all of the time, so I'm learning to live with it for now.",ByEddie E. Hicks,3

It has a lot of bass, the battery last a long time, and he enjoys messing with the light colors with his phone.Personally, I'd want a speaker with more mid-range. This has a lot of highs and lows, but the middle is rather weak. Its designed for the pop music he listens to and represents it very well; but for other styles you might want something different.",GRDad,5
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Impressive sound for the size!,"I was excited to open the Sony SRS XB30, as my previous bluetooth speaker was relatively cheap, and left a lot to be desired, sound-wise.So, opening up the box, which in itself is nice and tactile, you are greeted straight away by the speaker. No messing around. Pulled it out and powered it up. The indicator in the SongPal app (I'll get to that later) showed 50% charge, so that was great, meant I could use it right out of the box. Sync'd it to my phone (without instructions) by pressing the big bluetooth button and then looking for it on my phone (just like you would with any other bluetooth device). Paired up really quickly. Chose my first song to play through it and away I went. Bam! The little speaker had a nice punch, straight out of the gate! I was very impressed, almost taken aback as I checked it out. Turned the volume up and it sounded great. Then, as anyone would, you HAVE to press the EXTRA BASS button. When you do, dual passive radiators work together with stereo full-range speakers to enhance the low-end tones, giving bass a nice boost  despite the speakers compact size. Basically, it sounds fantastic! However, I found that the speaker sounds fantastic, at a lower volume and when you are close to it. As I stepped away from the speaker and turned up the volume, the bass intensity dropped and more higher end sounds took precedence. I live in a moderately sized home with 25ft ceilings in the living room and the speaker was able to fill the room with sound, but didn't sound quite as bass-backed as it did when the volume was lower and I was closer to it. However, I am still very impressed with what this speaker can do, considering it's size. On to the SongPal app... I opened it up and got the speaker hooked up to it, and from there you can change many settings on the speaker. It has an illuminated LED ring around it and two strobe lights. You can turn them on and off and you can control certain colors of the ring with predetermined color pattens within the app. But you cannot directly choose the color with a color wheel. You can also check battery status, power settings, adjust the EXTRA BASS and more. The unit claims a 24 hour battery life (when not using the lights on it) and so far, it's living up to it's claims. You can connect via bluetooth as mentioned or also via USB.You can also link speakers, so if you have more than one of them, you can link them for stereo sounds. And if you want more, you can link up to 10 of them together for a full on party atmosphere! The speaker is also water-resistant, not completely waterproof. So don't drop it in the pool and expect it to work, but it is splash proof and spill proof, so you can take it and use it at the beach as long as you make sure that the internal components cover is securely fastened, as Sony mentions many times in the instruction manual!You can connect up to three devices to it as well, although I haven't tried this feature as I would only use it with my phone. I would love to see a power indicator on my phone as to how much power is left in the speaker. I use a pair of Sony Bluetooth Headphones (MDR-XB70BT) every day and they provide a little icon showing how much charge is left in them on my phone. That would be useful with the speaker, as I may not always use the SongPal app when using the speaker. As for the SongPal app, I had an issue with the speaker connecting twice to it, and then not registering either of them. I had to erase the speakers and reconnect them. Not a deal breaker but it made the SongPal app feel a little clunky. It would be nice to have a color wheel to choose individual colors for the LED ring around the speaker, but again, not a deal breaker, but a nice to have feature. Overall I am very impressed with the Sony SRS XB30 Bluetooth Speaker and I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation.",Cupra,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Good Value at this Price Point,"This is the third Bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers. However the other two have price points higher than this Sony XB30 with a $149.99 MSRP (one is $50 higher and the other is $100 higher).The Sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear (the back one is for a passive radiator). The unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece. The front grille is surrounded by a light bar that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes, none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played. The light show variations cannot be accessed directly from the speakers built-in controls, you have to make changes from the SongPal app (which is free), but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker. The jacks for power, audio in, and USB connection (to charge your phone from the speaker) are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is IPX5 rated for water resistance. Note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromised.The Extra Bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it, leaves the speaker sounding kind of tinny or thin when it is turned off. I did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from iTunes via my iPhone 6 and when connected with a cable to an iPod Classic playing Apple Lossless files. The SongPal app has a rudimentary three-band graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass, midrange and treble from flat to +10 or -10 with three sliders. The bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content I listened to, but the treble control had virtually no effect that I could tell.Two features I was not able to try out were the Wireless Party Chain since I have only one Sony speaker and the LDAC audio technology which is a higher quality Bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary Sony technology available on their ZX2 High-Resolution Audio Walkman and Xperia smartphones.I realize I am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age, but I am a little confused by the combination of the multicolored line light and flashing strobe that would have probably appealed to the 12-year-old me along with the LDAC technology that comes in a $1200 hi-res music player that the 60-year-old me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing. I would expect someone with a high-resolution, audiophile-quality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than this.The XB30 has a built-in microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speaker/mic. Sound quality was far superior to the iPhones speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation (to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices). This feature helps the XB30 earn a place on your work desk.I think the XB-30 represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other Bluetooth speakers I am familiar with, however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing, at least to me. Sound quality can be a rather subjective matter, and to be fair I was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a LDAC capable device. There are many other players at this price level, so I suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision.",pillboy,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,BIG DILEMMA,"After a few minutes playing with SONY's new XB30, I knew I was in trouble. Too many nieces and nephews who would feel left out if I gifted any one of them and not any of the others with this truly fun music box. Great sound, immense power handling, colorful, bright, and wickedly cool. Took mere seconds to get my laptop connected to the SONY XB30. Hit play and Adam Levine was sounding big, bold and great filling my large family room on this rather pint-sized sound box. Disconnected it from my laptop, and pulled out my iPhone 6. Within minutes I was playing Feist with perfect sound quality. My iPhone offered to download a Sony App to further control the XB30, but it was not necessary. It does let me adjust the volume from the App so I don't need to go up to the Sony XB30, but so what.The SONY XB30 has a few special tricks. A double click of the play button skips you forward. A 3 click pattern jumps you backwards in the song. It will apparently tie together with multiple SONY devices of this special EXTRA BASS SERIES so the kids can have a really loud party. Yikes. Oh . . . and it's a L-I-G-H-T S-H-O-W. Yeah, it lights up like an 80s disco. Shrink that massive boom box from the 70s/80s into a milk carton size (quart!), double the volume, add a light show and it connects with whatever music library you have on your phone. Not bad. Not bad at all. I'm gonna need to get a few more of these.SUMMARY: If there is something I could bring back from a visit to the 1980s, it might be the totally frivolous spirit of musical fun embodied by boom boxes. Boom boxes, for the too-young-to-know, were portable, but powerfully loud, all-in-one stereos that could entertain your moving party. Sony brings back all of the fun and eliminates the unnecessary. The ubiquitous smart phone has all the music you could ever carry, and bluetooth links to Sonys powerful speaker. Add to the mix a light show using LEDs creating little burden on your portable power, youre ready to go.",TECHBEENGOOD,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,EXTRA Bass with the touch of a button,"The Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker provides amazing lighting to go with any sort of music that you're playing, provides a small and portable design, making it super easy to be taken anywhere (even near water, a little water won't hurt this speaker), and the battery power to keep the music going all night (or day) long. The sound is amazing and if you need an extra kick up in Bass, all you have to do is hit the EXTRA Bass button on the far left of the speaker. Simple, easy, and doesn't distract you from doing whatever you're already doing.Connecting to the speaker is easy, you can either connect via Bluetooth or if you prefer, make sure you have NFC (Near Field Communication) turned on for your device and just bring the device and speaker close to one another and bam, you're connected and ready to play music or whatever audio you want to play. The speaker can be connected to smartphones, tablets, computers, and pretty much everything else with Bluetooth connectivity. You can even connect up to 10 other Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers together, creating a Party Chain of Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speakers. Or make it simple and connect another Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker for wider stereo sound. Or if you want to skip (or don't have Bluetooth or NFC) connecting wirelessly, you can always connect a 3.5mm cable into the AUX port in the back of the speaker.To further customize your Sony XB30 Bluetooth Speaker, you can install the Sony companion app that can be installed on your device so you can control more features and settings on the speaker. You can turn off or change the mood lighting used by the speaker, you can change the timer for when the speaker turns off on its own after being inactive for a certain period of time, and you can even turn the speaker off with the companion app if you're not near the speaker.",BravoMan,5

Base boost is exactly as advertised and plenty of it. You can definetly hear the difference. Set up wasn't a problem because a free Geek Squad appointment included in the purchase didn't take 5 minutes to complete. Bada bing...bada boom... and out the door with portable tunes blarring from my new XB30. In case you're wondering, the XB30 is WAY more speaker than the XB20 and a LOT less expensive than the XB40.

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,"Excellent Bluetooth Speaker, Horrible App Support","As far as bluetooth speakers go, this one has amazing sound clarity, volume, and battery life. It charges quickly and pairs well and fast, staying connected with a minimum of issues. The extra bass mode is fantastic and certainly carries the oomph of a much larger speaker.My only complaint is that this speaker is best for party mode. It features an LED ring around the primary facing and two strobes. These lights seemly cannot be turned off (there is no physical button to do so) except through an app you must run on your smartphone. The SongPal app is rated 2 stars on the App Store at the moment, and once you open it, it's clear why. The app can't connect to the speaker, a setup protocol is required, and it doesn't seem to recognize that you're already connected to the speaker in Bluetooth mode. It's not clear if you can shut off the ""party mode"" lights or not as I was never able to get it to connect after several attempts.I haven't tried splashing the speaker with water, although it's clear from the housing near the charging port that the product is water resistant. Sturdy and built well, but not prohibitively heavy - it's the right size to join you at the pool or at the office (provided your coworkers like to party if you can't get the SongPal app to work).Ultimately, this is a really, really nice bluetooth speaker - and if you just leave it as-is, it's pretty darn cool. But if you had to put it in a business setting where LED lighting effects and strobes aren't going to fly, you might want to test out the SongPal app in store before you go much further.",NickAtWTF,4

It has two passive radiators for more bass. The battery life is amazing at around 20 hours as tested with sound around 40%-60% depending on the time and etc. The one thing I dislike about this speaker it doesn't charge with micro USB and needs the cable that came with the device. This does have a USB male connector to charge your device though. I also like that it is water resistant so I don't have to worry about splashing it accidentally or etc as well.

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,"Sony XB30 - Good, but not perfect.","Despite its best efforts to scare me off, I actually do like this speaker a lot. Unboxing the speaker two things immediately struck me. First, the speaker is smaller than I'd thought it would be based on the box (lots of packing materials to keep it safe). Second, the speaker feels surprisingly heavy given its size. It only weighs a little more than 2 pounds according to my kitchen scale, but it feels a lot heavier than that when you're holding it in your hand. I got the speaker in blue (one of my favorite colors). The blue is a duskier shade than I was expecting, but it's still pleasing to the eye. That being said, I do regret not having picked this up in black as it would have coordinated with my furniture better. The texture is lightly rubberized and purports to be water resistant. The front of the speaker bears an LED light ring that can be customized to hit a range of different colors. All of the speaker's ports are hidden behind a door on the back right-hand side. It came with a great big notice taped to it advising you to make sure that the door is shut when the unit is in use. I can only presume that this is to ensure the unit's water resistance as it seems to operate perfectly fine with the door wide open. A surprising addition to the ports is a traditional USB type A port. It should be noted that this port is for power output only and does not support power input or data transfer. The documentation says that the port is included to charge one's phone or tablet using the speaker. This is a nice addition, but it feels a little random to me. Turning it on proved to be the first stumbling block for this review. Following the instructions, I charged the device for four hours prior to attempting to use it. With the speaker still plugged into the wall, I pressed the power button . . . and nothing happened. I tried pressing it several times and got no response whatsoever. I worried that I might have received a defective unit, but unplugging the device from the wall and pressing the power button finally yielded results with the device promptly turning on. Oddly, this was the only time that I encountered this issue. I have since left it plugged in and pressed the power button, and it turns on right away. Charging proved to be another oddity with this device. Using it for about two hours, I was down to 75% battery according to the phone app that goes with this speaker. With the speaker still on, I plugged it in to see about charging it while using it. An hour later, the app still reported a battery status of 75%. I'm not sure whether this is a characteristic of the device itself or a glitch with the phone app. Pairing the device was simple enough on an android phone. I did have to turn my Bluetooth on and off to get it to show up, but I suspect that was the result of a bug on my phone and not with this speaker. The app that works with this speaker is a little too generic and lacks polish. This is where things start to go downhill. First, the big selling point for this speaker is its ability to wirelessly pair up and synchronize with other speakers from this series to create a stereo or surround sound effect. I couldn't test this as I only had a single speaker to work with. Sony really ought to consider selling these in multi-packs if they're going to make such a big deal of this capability. I knew from my own research prior to getting this speaker that this capability only works with other speakers from this series. You can't use other bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers or even other models of Sony speakers to do this. That being said, the language in the app is very vague and makes it sound like you can grab any old bluetooth speaker to create a wireless speaker network. Curious to see if this was actually the case, I grabbed a pair of bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers and attempted to pair them. Sadly, as expected, neither one of them would pair. Second, the app's control of the customizable LED light ring isn't quite what I was led to believe given the packaging and documentation. My hope was to use this speaker with my home theater system and have it paired with my home theater PC rather than a phone or tablet. Given the speaker's ability to link up with other speakers, I'd had thoughts about maybe using this to eventually implement a wireless surround sound and/or whole home speaker system. My PC setup has a nice blue LED lighting effect, and I thought it would be cool to get the LED ring on the speaker to match the blue that the rest of my setup has. That's when I discovered the second shortcoming of the app. You can't select a single color for the LED ring to glow. The app only gives you a list of preset color schemes that you can choose to have it cycle through. You can't select just a single color and tell the speaker to hold it continuously (special PSA on the lighting: if you're epileptic, don't attempt to use this speaker until you adjust the color settings. By default, this speaker came in ""RAVE"" mode which has white flashing strobes along the left and right edges. There was no mention of this strobe effect in any of the materials I read prior to getting this speaker, and it's a little disturbing that this was enabled by default). Third, the voice control button within the app doesn't appear to actually do anything. Pressing it prompts you to say a keyword. I tried saying ""Sony,"" ""Speaker,"" ""Hey you,"" and ""Play Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody,'"" but I had no luck getting the app or speaker to react. Pressing the help button within the app didn't lead me to anything offering any support for this. Saying ""Google"" did pull up a screen with icons for Google Music and Youtube, but I couldn't get the app to do anything beyond that point using voice controls. Unfortunately, the shortcomings aren't limited to just the app. The speaker also has a button on the top for bass boost. Upon first using the speaker, I was very impressed by the sound. It was clear and loud with a lot of punch to it. Curious to see what it would sound like with even more bass, I pressed the bass button on the top . . . and the sound immediately went flat and tinny. Apparently, the bass button was already enabled by default. Given the way that this is set up, the bass button is less of a boost button and more of a ""make my music sound anemic and bad"" button. The perception would have been much improved had they not opted to have this enabled by default. Using the speaker on a phone call yielded mixed results. The audio came over both loud and crystal clear on my end. That being said, the person on the other line said that my voice was distant and full of distortion. Suffice it to say, that speaker's microphone isn't very good. A couple of warnings if you're going to try and use this as a speaker on a PC. First, you won't be able to control the speaker's settings from the PC. You're going to have to use the phone app to control things like power management and the LED lighting. Secondly, you're going to want to go into the power management options within the app to turn off the auto-off power saving feature. This feature is enabled by default. The speaker doesn't automatically wake after powering down. If you don't turn off the auto-off, then you will be forced to press the power button on the speaker to turn it back on after it powers down. The amazing thing is that despite the shortcomings that I've listed, I still really like this speaker. The LED lighting is fun, the sound is terrific with lots of volume and bass, and the aesthetic is nice and clean. Is the speaker perfect? No. Is the speaker really good? Yes. Despite the shortcomings, I'm still seriously considering buying another one to use in my home theater setup. I would recommend this product.",TechEnthusiast,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Sony is making a comeback,"After many past models they have put themselves ahead of the competition as far as sound for the money is concerned. XB20- looks like the beats pill but sounds way better; also sounds better than the bose mini/color. $100 starting if on budget, but it sure won't look or sound that way. XB30- Sounds better than Bose Soundlink 3, also the the new Bose that looks like a cone, superior sound the the JBL because I get a more accurate stereo sound and is superior the the Harmon/Kardon Onyx (strange design is not portable, placement can be annoying, battery is junk and interface is horrible. At $150 this is the best bang for your buck. XB40- sounds like a true hifi stereo due to separation, large accurate acoustics, amazing mids, deeper bass (can be tamed using app if desired), it is the largest out of the 3 but is still very portable. $250 sound for pool parties and large gatherings. All 3 speakers can fit in a backpack, seem to be tailored for a wide range of customers and settings can be made/saved on device utilizing Sony app. Fairly user friendly using iPhone or Andriod. I've purchased and returned many Bluetooth brands to Best Buy and this time I'm very happy.

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Excellent bluetooth speaker w/lots of features.,"First, the sound quality is excellent, all the way up to full volume, always the first measure of a speaker. It can be made quite loud, sufficient for a room full of people or a patio party. The sound is quite pleasing with or without the ""Extra Bass"" function, which increases the bass, but not to the point of thumping over the music.I was able to easily pair and use the speaker with my phone, tv, and Amazon Echo Dot, which really increased the utility. No more recharging after an hour or two either; the battery is spec'ed at 24hrs life with a 4 hr recharge and I believe it. I had it on all day without recharging. When I finally recharged it, it was done in a couple of hours. The charging port for a phone or other device is a bonus. The outside is rubberized and claims IPX5 water resistance, which is nice on the patio, especially this winter. There are 'Party Lights', which are not too obtrusive and can be turned off at the speaker.The Sony SongPal app lets you do everything the speaker buttons do and more. It has a basic equalizer, allows more control over the lights, and can 'sync' multiple speakers, so you can slave multiple speakers to one phone and spread them around the house or whatever. I didn't try this feature, since it would require multiple speakers.Negatives are relatively minor. There is no carrying case. The app is fairly hefty (44M on Android), but not really necessary. The lights don't appear to sync to the music except for a couple of white LED strobes on either end of the speakers.",rtbestbuy,5

The value and quality of the product can't be beat. The size is small and portable, yet the sound quality is impressive. The battery charge has always been sufficient for our needs.The SRS-XB30 adds another fun component with the lights and strobe. The light colors rotate and encircle the front perimeter of the speaker face. One simply holds down the Extra Bass button if you choose to not use the lights, but simply listen to music.This speaker is easy to set up by simply connecting through Bluetooth on one's phone. I prefer the sound with Extra Bass turned on. We will definitely be using this by the pool this summer since it offers water resistance and has a speaker phone option.I highly recommend this product for the sound quality, portability and value.",allib,5

You'd swear the sound was coming out of my Sony AV amplifier and bookshelf speakers.Big bass, clear mid-tones and highs. Truly amazing sound.I paired the speakers and my phone with the phone's Bluetooth setup. Very easy.Then I read you can load the Sony NFC app and pair your device with NFC by just touching the phone to the center of the Sony speaker. Nice feature. This is the perfect addition for my Amazon Echo DOT.The unit is rechargeable so it's truly portable. The boom box sound for todays connected world. I can't wait to take it to the beach. The speaker's volume buttons control the player device's volume so be sure to turn down our phone before connecting.

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,"Great sound, poor battery","The speaker provides great sound with a great boost to bass when chosen to use it. The strobe light on it gives it uniqueness and can be fun for gatherings. The light may be turned on and off easily as well as the option for extra bass. The downside I find with this speaker is that even when it is fully charged, that it does not maintain nearly as long as the box states it will last up to. The sound will get quiet and you will have to keep restarting it to keep the optimal volume. I have turned off the lights and the bass to see if there would be a noticeable difference and there was not. It is good for a 2-3 hour use, but don't expect to get much more than that. If the battery lasted longer I would definitely recommend it, but for the price paid with the lack of battery life I am unable to give this recommendation.",Nelson982,3

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Oh my gosh,"Disclaimer: I received this product for free from Best Buy and Sony in exchange for my honest review.Oh my gosh, dear Bluetooth speaker, where have you been all my life? I've always just settled for streaming music through my Apple TV/Insignia TV, my laptop, or my phone...but this little thing is a game changer. The sound is great, the extra bass is great, and the lights are a fun little bonus! The setup took less than a minute - you literally only have to turn it on, and then go to the Bluetooth screen on your phone or device and sync them. That's it. You can control the sound and the song selection from your phone using the volume controls and music app. Sony has a couple of iOS apps you can use, but I didn't bother downloading them, because I will likely just use it to play music in my apartment. Also, the color of the speaker is NOT bright blue like the pictures show, it is basically black (I actually had to look at the paperwork again because I thought I was sent the wrong product. I think I actually prefer the dark blue to the bright blue anyway.",erinb16,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,"Great speaker, terrible battery","I was browsing around for a high quality portable speaker and was deciding between this and a bose speaker. The design, extra bass, water resistant and *24 hour battery life got my attention, so I decided I'd go for the XB30. I didn't purchase the warranty Best Buy offers thinking I had a great speaker and I wouldn't have to worry about anything. Yep I was wrong. Battery life is terrible! I can't even get more than 6 or 7 hours on 50 to 70% volume ( I have neighbors) on something that claims to go up to 24 hours? Maybe 24 hours with no sound playing and just the speaker on with the lights. Worst part is I've only had it about a month. Maybe it's just my unit, but I'm very disappointed. If Sony replies, don't tell me to factory reset because I've tried that and it still sucks... how about giving me my money back?",TheJuanAndOnly,3

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great Portable Speaker!,We needed a small bluetooth speaker for our pontoon boat because the built in stereo was broken and I wanted something that was portable for other uses. I tested out several at the store and loved the size and especially the shape of this model. It was a little more expensive than what I had wanted to pay and actually bought another one at Costco that was on sale to compare. We ended up taking the less expensive one back...(you get what you pay for!) The sound quality on this little thing is excellent! It was very easy to sync with my cell phone and easy to carry. Once we had it on the boat it sounded great! Love the extra bass boost and especially the light show (which you can control from the app)...it looks really cool on the lake at night. You can also use it as a bluetooth speaker for your cell phone and take calls.,LakeSound,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,"Good, but, not great...","I recieved this XB30, in exchange for my honest review...Not impressed with the sound from this bluetooth speaker. It has a Bassy & Dull sound to it! For 150.00, it Lacks Highs badly... For example, I have a 40.00 Phillips bluetooth speaker ( SBT300), that plays Clearer than this Sony. Also, the 40.00 Phillips, is 3x larger than this SRS-XB30 Sony! While the Sony has decent Bass, it truely lacks High frequencies. Highs, come across muddy.If you like Bass, and leds, this bluetooth speaker module is for you. If you like clear high frequencies, as I do. I reccommend skipping this, Id rather have better performing Speakers, vs the flashing and color changing leds!I do like that rhis has a rechargable battery, built in. You can also plug your phone or mp3 player directly into this for audio, via 3.5mm adapter. As well as charging, via supplied usb rear input.",Todd,3

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,good all around speaker,"I received this product as part of the Best Buy Tech Insider program for my honest review. The sony xb30 bluetooth speaker is a good bluetooth accessory but not perfect. To my ears, the sound seems a little muffled. The highs and mid range sounds don't seem as sharp and crisp as I had hoped. I'm not saying that the sound is bad, because it isn't, but maybe I expected a little more. sound volume is good for indoor use or outdoors if you are going to be near the speaker. It is not a speaker you could use to provide music for a large group or a pool party or something similar. If you are hanging out by the pool or at the beach, this speaker has plenty of volume, howerver. One thing I would change on the speaker is the charging system. The speaker has a proprietary charger. I would have much rather they sent a usb charger of some type to charge of of a computer or where you could use an existing cell phone charger when you need to add a little power. the speaker will last a long time on a single charge, however, so you shouldn't be charging all that often unless you are a power user. The speaker is good for what I will use it for - sitting around a campsite or watching my little girls dance to music off my phone in the backyard. Its a good speaker with some potential.",beefrob,4

I wanted to get a JBL because i knew they were waterproof and sounded great, but once a Best Buy employee let me open a Charge 3 and compare it to this XB30, I was amazed at the difference. This speaker sounds AMAZING. The only reason the employee let me hear this one is because he bought one for his father too. I'm very glad he opened my eyes because i would have overlooked this great speaker. Thinking about buying one for myself now.",ArmoredIndy,5
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great little speaker,"This is a great little speaker for the price. It is very loud and does have good bass. The sound can be a little higher because the bass is a bit overpowering but there is an equalizer that can change how the sound comes out. I did wish the battery was more accurate. It says 24 hours but they don't tell you that it's with the lights off, bass boost off and I'm not sure at what volume it has to be to get that kind of battery life. But i would say realistically at about half volume with the lights and bass boost turned off you can get 12 to maybe 16 hours.",Osbrandon,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Quality Sound,"This little guy packs a punch! The extra bass boost creates a solid sound and the battery life lasts a long time; I've had it for around six weeks, used it on 5-6 occasions for several hours at a time without another charge. Also, it hooks Tony iPhone via Bluetooth without the addition of their ""mandatory"" app, which I did try but was a pain to use. Great product!",Andi,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Good,This speaker is pretty good the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the base even when it's not on extra base mode can sometimes be to much. Other then that it's pretty good.,Anthony,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Big speaker with big sound,"The XB30 is a big, heavy portable speaker that can fill a room with sound. Pairing with an iPad and also an Android smartphone was a snap, and I experienced very little static or lag moving upwards of 20-25 feet from the speaker. This unit features an Extra Bass button, and you really need it: when off, the sound lacks the full, rich signature Sony sound.One of the selling points of this machine is a lights feature. This speaker can flash like a strobe light or emanate mood lighting for different settings like cool, warm, party, etc. While it is a nice feature, accessing it requires the downloading of a free app to your smart device, which can be a turn-off for consumers.Soundwise, the XB30 is really a room-filler. Physically, it's not as small as some other devices on the market, but what you lack in portability you gain in massive sonic appeal. Bottom line, this is what you're really looking for.",NJRY,4
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great sound and battery life,"We purchased this device for a beach vacation. The speaker is very durable. It was also quite loud.

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Speaker is Nice,"The speaker is solid and feels very nice and is portable. It is a little heavier than I would like. I wanted this so I could use it by the pool during the summer and not worry about it falling over or getting wet. The set up was extremely easy and the buttons were easy to press and responsive. I love the lighting that blinks to the beat. The main reason for not giving this 5 stars is the sound. It does not sound as dynamic, the sound just come straight at you, it does not surround you. When you press the extra bass button it is ok. I was hoping this would sound amazing because I have their wireless TV speaker system and headphones, but was disappointed. I love Sony products so I will not give up on this speaker. At this price point I would consider it.",Olive,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great for a small speaker,"For a fairly small speaker, the sound was great!! If you want a speaker for a large area, go with the Ion box type speaker which is quite a bit larger yet the same price as this one.

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great battery life,"I got this one because of the great battery life. The sound is average, and the bass boost has to be turned off most of the time. When songs are supposed to have that massive amount, you can turn it on without drowning out the rest of the sound. The flashing lights are neat at first, but I have them off too. Overall, it's decent, but not amazing.",Joel,3
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Good Value at this Price Point,"This is the third Bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers. However the other two have price points higher than this Sony XB30 with a $149.99 MSRP (one is $50 higher and the other is $100 higher).The Sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear (the back one is for a passive radiator). The unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece. The front grille is surrounded by a “light bar” that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes, none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played. The “light show” variations cannot be accessed directly from the speaker’s built-in controls, you have to make changes from the SongPal app (which is free), but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker. The jacks for power, audio in, and USB connection (to charge your phone from the speaker) are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is IPX5 rated for water resistance. Note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromised.The Extra Bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it, leaves the speaker sounding kind of “tinny” or “thin” when it is turned off. I did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from iTunes via my iPhone 6 and when connected with a cable to an iPod Classic playing Apple Lossless files. The SongPal app has a rudimentary three-band graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass, midrange and treble from flat to +10 or -10 with three sliders. The bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content I listened to, but the treble control had virtually no effect that I could tell.Two features I was not able to try out were the “Wireless Party Chain” since I have only one Sony speaker and the LDAC audio technology which is a higher quality Bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary Sony technology available on their ZX2 High-Resolution Audio Walkman and Xperia smartphones.I realize I am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age, but I am a little confused by the combination of the “multicolored line light and flashing strobe” that would have probably appealed to the 12-year-old me along with the LDAC technology that comes in a $1200 hi-res music player that the 60-year-old me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing. I would expect someone with a high-resolution, audiophile-quality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than this.The XB30 has a built-in microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speaker/mic. Sound quality was far superior to the iPhone’s speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation (to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices). This feature helps the XB30 earn a place on your work desk.I think the XB-30 represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other Bluetooth speakers I am familiar with, however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing, at least to me. Sound quality can be a rather subjective matter, and to be fair I was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a LDAC capable device. There are many other players at this price level, so I suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision.",pillboy,4

I was going to the lake for the weekend and wanted music in camp so I let the sales associate talk me into settling for the downsized XB30. I should have waited. The sound is not nearly as rich, and the bass is sub-standard. Whats worse, when I pushed the ""Mega Bass"" button in an effort to bump it up, I was rewarded with an annoying buzzing each time the bass hit. I subsequently returned the XB30 to Best Buy and upgraded to the XB40, which I have been very pleased with.",Doug,2

The battery is clearly a strong value with delivery times clearly over other (more pricy) speakers. The bass adjustments and the lights changing the color with the music add a funny touch for the kids parties.I liked the possibility to charge your phone (it has a USB plug on the back) in case you are reproducing music and running out of battery.I didn't put the fifth star because I found that the bluetooth connection sometimes is not as fast or automatic as other devices and sometimes I need to access to the app recommended by the manufacturer (from where you can do adjustments to the speaker), that in my opinion is not up to the standards of the speaker itself.",Luis,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great speaker for the price,"I was between this and the jbl charge 3 which at the time were the same price. What led me to the Sony was just the great track record I've had with their products. The sound out of this speaker compared to the charge 3 was really close overall but I think it's obvious from the name of the Sony that the bass was more of the focus on it. With the extra bass feature aside I think it's just about the same in quality. The determining factor for those comparing the two would come down to that feature I believe, and well the light show it creates if you're into that. As far as durability the jbl may be a bit more since it is ipx7 instead of ipx5 like the Sony. Although I will say, I did drop the Sony in a 5 ft river accidentally and couldn't find it for a minute but still worked perfectly fine after I got it out.",EdBot,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Impressive sound for the size!,"I was excited to open the Sony SRS XB30, as my previous bluetooth speaker was relatively cheap, and left a lot to be desired, sound-wise.So, opening up the box, which in itself is nice and tactile, you are greeted straight away by the speaker. No messing around. Pulled it out and powered it up. The indicator in the SongPal app (I'll get to that later) showed 50% charge, so that was great, meant I could use it right out of the box. Sync'd it to my phone (without instructions) by pressing the big bluetooth button and then looking for it on my phone (just like you would with any other bluetooth device). Paired up really quickly. Chose my first song to play through it and away I went. Bam! The little speaker had a nice punch, straight out of the gate! I was very impressed, almost taken aback as I checked it out. Turned the volume up and it sounded great. Then, as anyone would, you HAVE to press the EXTRA BASS button. When you do, dual passive radiators work together with stereo full-range speakers to enhance the low-end tones, giving bass a nice boost — despite the speakers compact size. Basically, it sounds fantastic! However, I found that the speaker sounds fantastic, at a lower volume and when you are close to it. As I stepped away from the speaker and turned up the volume, the bass intensity dropped and more higher end sounds took precedence. I live in a moderately sized home with 25ft ceilings in the living room and the speaker was able to fill the room with sound, but didn't sound quite as bass-backed as it did when the volume was lower and I was closer to it. However, I am still very impressed with what this speaker can do, considering it's size. On to the SongPal app... I opened it up and got the speaker hooked up to it, and from there you can change many settings on the speaker. It has an illuminated LED ring around it and two strobe lights. You can turn them on and off and you can control certain colors of the ring with predetermined color pattens within the app. But you cannot directly choose the color with a color wheel. You can also check battery status, power settings, adjust the EXTRA BASS and more. The unit claims a 24 hour battery life (when not using the lights on it) and so far, it's living up to it's claims. You can connect via bluetooth as mentioned or also via USB.You can also link speakers, so if you have more than one of them, you can link them for stereo sounds. And if you want more, you can link up to 10 of them together for a full on party atmosphere! The speaker is also water-resistant, not completely waterproof. So don't drop it in the pool and expect it to work, but it is splash proof and spill proof, so you can take it and use it at the beach as long as you make sure that the internal components cover is securely fastened, as Sony mentions many times in the instruction manual!You can connect up to three devices to it as well, although I haven't tried this feature as I would only use it with my phone. I would love to see a power indicator on my phone as to how much power is left in the speaker. I use a pair of Sony Bluetooth Headphones (MDR-XB70BT) every day and they provide a little icon showing how much charge is left in them on my phone. That would be useful with the speaker, as I may not always use the SongPal app when using the speaker. As for the SongPal app, I had an issue with the speaker connecting twice to it, and then not registering either of them. I had to erase the speakers and reconnect them. Not a deal breaker but it made the SongPal app feel a little clunky. It would be nice to have a color wheel to choose individual colors for the LED ring around the speaker, but again, not a deal breaker, but a nice to have feature. Overall I am very impressed with the Sony SRS XB30 Bluetooth Speaker and I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation.",Cupra,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Superb sound! Loud and crisp! It's a SONY!!!,"Spent more than an hour at the store listening/deliberating between Sony and Bose. Sony hands down won! Features like easy one touch pairing with my Samsung phone, long battery life, power bank charger, rubbery case is well made than Bose's plastic exterior, lights are awesome and classier compared to JBL's tacky lava-like lights and the SOUND is SUPERB!!! Was able to play it out of the box. Did not download the app, very satisfied with the quality of the sound. At max volume, sound frequencies like highs, mids and lows are maintained and does not get distorted thus I found no need to have an equalizer from the app. Always take into consideration the source ( Pandora, Spotify, Youtube, Mp3, etc ) you're getting the music from because it's crucial to the overall output of the sound. I listen to Pandora and recordings are consistently crisp, full and clear. Some sites have inferior recordings, no matter how much tweaking you do with an equalizer it will still produce an inferior, muffled and distorted sound. Another feature I've noticed is when paused for a considerable amount of time, it turns itself off. Compared to the XB40, XB30 IMO delivered a crispier, undistorted sound at max volume. XB40 was slightly louder, a given. Could not be happier with my choice. Growing up Sony was already a household name in quality and performance. With the proliferation of newer and good brands in the market today, Sony has retained its global reputation of excellence in electronics technology. Time spent at Best Buy wasn't wasted and was on sale. Lastly, the red is gorgeous! More like red orange.",Jazzyhouse,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,BIG DILEMMA,"After a few minutes playing with SONY's new XB30, I knew I was in trouble. Too many nieces and nephews who would feel left out if I gifted any one of them and not any of the others with this truly fun music box. Great sound, immense power handling, colorful, bright, and wickedly cool. Took mere seconds to get my laptop connected to the SONY XB30. Hit play and Adam Levine was sounding big, bold and great filling my large family room on this rather pint-sized sound box. Disconnected it from my laptop, and pulled out my iPhone 6. Within minutes I was playing Feist with perfect sound quality. My iPhone offered to download a Sony App to further control the XB30, but it was not necessary. It does let me adjust the volume from the App so I don't need to go up to the Sony XB30, but so what.The SONY XB30 has a few special tricks. A double click of the play button skips you forward. A 3 click pattern jumps you backwards in the song. It will apparently tie together with multiple SONY devices of this special EXTRA BASS SERIES so the kids can have a really loud party. Yikes. Oh . . . and it's a L-I-G-H-T S-H-O-W. Yeah, it lights up like an 80s disco. Shrink that massive boom box from the 70s/80s into a milk carton size (quart!), double the volume, add a light show and it connects with whatever music library you have on your phone. Not bad. Not bad at all. I'm gonna need to get a few more of these.SUMMARY: If there is something I could bring back from a visit to the 1980s, it might be the totally frivolous spirit of musical fun embodied by boom boxes. Boom boxes, for the too-young-to-know, were portable, but powerfully loud, all-in-one stereos that could entertain your moving party. Sony brings back all of the fun and eliminates the unnecessary. The ubiquitous smart phone has all the music you could ever carry, and bluetooth links to Sony’s powerful speaker. Add to the mix a light show using LEDs creating little burden on your portable power, you’re ready to go.",TECHBEENGOOD,5
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Good product,"Overall, this is a nice product with good battery life. The only reason I did give it five stars is you have to adjust the equalizer depending on the volume you're listening your music at.",Bandykwel,4

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great Sound,"For the sound it produces, the battery lasts for quite a while.

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Easy review,Very easy to write this review. The item had a fast link up. It fill the room with music. Battery lasted a long time. Should've bought it along time ago.,jowilliy,5
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,"Sounds great, looks great","You can start a party anywhere with this speaker thanks to the built-in light show.PROs+ Sound quality: Obviously, one of the most important features of a speaker is the sound quality. The Sony XB30 certainly does not disappoint. Highs and mids come through clear and bass had some kick to it (if it's not enough for you, you can press the ""Extra Bass"" button for an enhanced effect). I tested streaming music from Apple Music, Pandora and Slacker Radio and was not disappointed with the sound quality of this speaker.+ Lights: I know some may find this gimmicky, but I really like the lights on this speaker. There is the outer ring that surrounds the speaker on the front that changes different colors and two white LED ""strobe"" lights on either side. You can set the lights to dance with the music, set a more calming lighting effect or turn off the lights completely by using the SongPal app. The lights really to add a bit of a party atmosphere and helps this speaker stand out from other brands.+ Bass booster: A quick press of ""Extra Bass"" button substantially increases lows and adds a great bass effect, especially considering the size of this speaker. However, it can make some songs sound a little ""muddy"" with an overemphasis on lows.+ NFC pairing: If your phone features an NFC chip, it can be used to quickly pair to this speaker with a tap. + Speakerphone support: You can answer incoming calls on this speaker by tapping the ""phone"" button. I tested this out and my friend said the sound quality was very good and he could hear me fine. However, if I stepped too far to one side, the noise cancellation feature seems to kick in and makes my voice harder to hear, so be sure you're in front of the speaker while using the phone feature.+ Siri support: You can also call up Siri by tapping the phone button and speaking a command.+ Bluetooth standby: A unique feature of this speaker is that you can leave it plugged in to an AC outlet and it will automatically turn on when you start playing music on your phone. It will go into standby mode (waiting for the next time you play music) if nothing plays for a period of time. This feature can be enabled in SongPal app.+ Charge your phone: The speaker has a USB port on the back. You can use your own charging cable to plug into this port and charge your phone while the speaker is on. This would obviously decrease the runtime of the speaker, but it can come in handy in a pinch.+ Pair with other Sony XB30 speakers: Another unique feature is the ability to pair this Bluetooth speaker with another similar Sony Bluetooth speaker. The other speakers must support the ""Wireless Party Chain"" function, which currently includes the SRS-XB20 , SRS-XB30 and SRS-XB40. Up to 10 speakers can be connected.+ Aux in: Non-Bluetooth devices can be used by using an audio cable with stereo mini plugs (not included).CONs- Proprietary charger: Unfortunately, this speaker cannot be recharged with a standard Micro USB or USB-C charger. It uses a barrel connector, meaning that you need to remember to bring the included charger with you (and make sure you don't lose it!). Fully charging the speaker takes about 4 hours.- No battery life indicator on iOS: Many newer Bluetooth speakers display their battery level on the iPhone/iPad status bar, so you can see when your speaker needs recharged. This Sony XB30 speaker does not do that, although you can use the SongPal app to find it (it's buried under the Settings option in the app). You can also hold down the ""phone"" button for about 3 seconds and the speaker will announce its current charge.- Buggy SongPal app: This speaker seems to use a separate Bluetooth connection when using the app, as I frequently receive messages from the SongPal app that my speaker needs to be paired even while it is currently streaming music from the same device. I've also seen multiple instances of the speaker appear in the app even though I'm only using one, so it looks like the SongPal app has some kinks to work out.Overall, I'm really happy with the sound quality of this speaker and the light show is a nice added bonus!",TechnicallyWell,5
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Nice portable speaker,I love this Sony XB-30 portable speaker. I have used it several times now and it lasts hours on a single charge. The sound quality is very good and the bluetooth feature allows me to use it in places where I can't access an outlet. The dancing lights are a nice feature but not something that is important to me.,Alan,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Great sound for a great price!,"I went to the store with the intent to purchase a Bose speaker. The Best Buy employee was great...he gave me the low down on all of the speakers in my price range (around $100), and gave me his personal opinion about this speaker...that it was the best sound for my buck. And he was right! It is as loud as you'd want a bluetooth speaker, and Sony's extra base makes it sound like a speaker you could use in your home as opposed to just on the go. It's 24-hour battery is WAY longer than any other I've seen...which I didn't think would even be something I'd need until the very first time I used it at our all day birthday party outside by the pool! I also didn't think I'd ever use the USB port until the second time we used it camping, and my phone died. I LOVE this speaker!!!",BooBoo,5

Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,"Great Price, Great Speaker","I actually listened to all of the speakers on display before selecting this one. The Sony had the sound I preferred especially with the extra bass option turned on.This was so simple and easy to connect to my iPod -- right out of the box. There are also apps you can download to change the light patterns. These range from mellow settings to the default which operates with the music. Another bonus was the option to connect more Sony speakers to this one, offering a fantastic surround sound for the home.Between us, we have an Altec, and a couple of JBLs, and I much prefer the sound of this one.",battwoman,5
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,good quality,Works well and plays pretty loud. Also cool lights that follow the beat of your music.,bodobrad,4
Sony,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,Awesome,So I bought this after being annoyed with my old UE boom box that didn't have enough bass. I wanted something louder and I got this. It was $117 and I think it's totally worth it. The colors that this speaker changes are quite cool. The Sony app lets you set the mood for the speaker and the music sounds so well. The sound is clear and no distortion follows. The bass is a thumping one. It's much louder than my ueboombox. Sony is improving quite well and I'm impressed with this device. I do notice there's a difference when you play music from Spotify vs Apple Music it's so much louder and deeper. To test this speaker you have to play many different genres. Coldplay sounds amazing and so does Travis Scott or Rihanna. A song with much production can make this speaker travel. I played confident by Demi Lovato while I showered and I could hear it over the shower and my grandma complained about the music being so loud. This is a very good speaker. Don't get the $130 jbl speaker I had it before this one and I returned it because of no bass. This speaker proved my return to be a good one.,Nattybuybuy,5

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Blown away and that's what I wanted!,"I've spent money recently on small portable Bluetooth speakers, but I always found myself at max volume wishing for so much more. When I listen to music, I want it to be an experience, not just a song. So, I decided to make a BIG leap in power, bypassing all of the pricier bluetooth portables that I knew I'd inevitably be disappointed in and opted for the new LBT-GPX555. Granted, I had to sacrifice portability and space in exchange for raw power, but it was a trade-off I was willing to make. And boy, I couldn't be happier! The audio quality and power from this system will literally blow you away and you'll be nervous to push the volume much past halfway. Plus, Sony's 2014 design style looks great with very futuristic angles and lines that compliment my 27-inch iMac in between the 2 speakers. Bluetooth functionality and the LED light show are the icing on the cake of an excellent product that should provide many years of listening pleasure. So, if you don't really need portability, don't spend hundreds on dinky sounding bluetooth speakers when you can have A LOT more sound for just a little bit more money.",PatriotInvasion12,5
Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Great dorm stereo,I bought this system for my dorm room. To be honest it is huge. It is much larger than any other system I was looking at. This is ok though because of the fact it produces so much sound. It would probabaly work fine in any space smaller than 5000 square-foot. It is very loud but has great bass too. It also has many features to help you make it have less bass too. I would recommend this system to college students. It does a great job starting a party and blocking out unwanted noise when studying.,Bethelite,5
Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Insane bass!!!!!!,I bought these speakers just over a year ago and they have been pumping out tunes daily ever since and I couldn't be any happier whether its for party's or just for everyday use these speakers have performed great. Now lets talk about the lights they have multiple different effects strobe being one of them every single time the bass hits everything flashes giving it a club ambiance which is extremely cool and is one of the reasons that when any friends come over they wonder where I purchased these speakers and how much they cost when I tell them the price its a pleasant surprise every time overall there great speakers to me and everyone that I know that has heard them... did I mention that set up took me only 10 minutes,SUBS,5
Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Love it,This message for Sony or any who reads it. I bought the Sony lbt gpx555 and the subwoofer is very hard to hear the music all I can only hear is some on the bass it that what the subwoofer supposed to do need to know if I have a defective unit. Because I had a sony shelf stereo with a subwoofer and it never sound like that I could hear the music.,Frankie78,5
Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Love it,I have a question for Sony it's about the subwoofer the sound that comes out of it is very low I can hear the bass but the person is singing you can barely here it.

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Good. Not Great,"The system is very slow for some reasons. It works well for the money spent, however, I bought a Sony many years ago and the design was more solid and the aesthetics was much more pleasing. This system looks very plastic and cheap and significantly slow in processing inputs. I am not particularly impressed with the wattage of the speakers as I was more interested in the purity of the sound not how loud it can go. Sony should stop competing with the Panasonics and rather try to produce quality materials like Bose.",WallyF,3
Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Outstanding sound system. Good price for quality.,This is a great audio system! High quality crisp clear sound even at high volume/high power. Can make any space a small night club (the bass can be seriously bumping If desired) or use it to play low volume clear and crisp classical music or jazz. Great price point for the quality of system and sound. Can't wait to have a pool party with it and bug my neighbors!,An anonymous customer,5
Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Great Sound System,"On the positive side: The sound is what I expected: GREAT On the negative side: The controls should be better user friendlier and the thin four wire in one connection from the system to the speakers are flimsy and easy to break, like it happened in my case, and I am trying to get it replaced but can not find it anywhere.",Sashatheone,4

The speakers are very clear and loud! She can hook her ipad up to it by Bluetooth and stream music or movies to the stereo. I was quite surprised at how loud if actually goes while still being clear and no static in the background. There are different color lights that the speakers illuminate and you can either change the colors or turn them off all together. Has a CD player and mic input as well.

It's loud enough for a house party or just to relax listening to music. The wire connections are a bit short and are not detachable and as such the speakers have to be close to the system. Blue tooth technology make it easy to listen to your favourite music on your iPod or phone or other device.

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Very good audio system from Sony.,I am very happy with my purchase of the Sony LBT-GPX555 audio system. It has completely changed the way I listen to music. Before my purchase of this audio system I was listening to music on my desk top computer through a pair of Bose speakers. I was not satisfied with the sound from this set up. I pair the Sony with my phone(LG Stylo2) and use aps like Napster(formerly Rhapsody) and YouTube. I also have a large collection of CDs so I can listen to them as well. My only complaint is the time it takes to read CDs when you put them in. On some CDs it takes from 15 to 20 seconds to first read the CD. When the CD player eventually goes bad as they always do I'll still be able to use the system with my phone.,ByMiguel A. Infante Jr.,4

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,"gpx555 review: zero low frequency bass response, muddy and dissapointing midrange and high range bass","i am using the gpx555 in a small commercial kitchen. it is a foregone conclusion that the acoustics are horrendous. moreover there are oven hoods, stoves, and hot and cold tables whooshing and rattling, machines spinning and making egregious screeching noises, fans blowing, buzzers doorbells and phones going off, and people shouting and cursing at each other and etc.the gpx555 has pretty good overall sound reproduction quality and plenty of volume even in this less than ideal setting. the volume control is stepless and increments in single values from 0-50. of course somebody had to mash it all the way up within seconds of the thing being plugged in, with some kind of pantera or slipknot or ratm crap. it sounded very loud, very good, and there was no discernible clipping or distortion. this lasted only a few seconds as it was much too loud (which is a good thing), and we settled on 35 for the rest of night: as loud as possible while still being able to communicate using raised voices (which everyone has to do anyway to be understood irrespective of any superficial tertiary electronically engendered harmonic dissonance)i was allocated a budget of 400usd and the only other unit i considered was the samsung mx js5000 for around 300usd because it had so many reviews. however again and again i heard people complaining about the lack of bass so i decided to go with the gpx555 because it had a dedicated 10 inch subwoofer.the only space i have available is on top of one of the coolers about 8 feet above the ground. i know from past experience that subwoofer placement can have a significant effect on the amount of bass that is output but floor space is at a premium and even if there was a corner of the floor available the proprietary cords that connect the head unit to all three speakers preclude the use of any normal monster cable extension.perhaps it is because the subwoofer is high above the ground and not near a corner, but i am really disapointed with the low frequency bass response. granted i didnt have very high expectations for an all in one shelf stereo priced at circa 380usd, but i was hopeful (read: naive) that the dedicated 10 inch subwoofer this unit touted which differentiated it from its peers would deliver some facsimile of accurate bass response.unfortunately at least in my location and application the low end just isnt there at all. contrariwise, there is some weak muddy midrange and high range bass to be sure, but i know the music i like well enough to really miss the low thunderous bass hits that should drop. i tried out some 2pac only god can judge me now and wonda why they call u bitchsic, some stevie ray vaughan riviera paradise, little wing and chitlins con carne, some bob marley time will tell and some ratatat songs from the album classics.all of these songs have some nice low frequency bass that hits you in the chest and rattles the walls and windows when it drops on a system with a capable subwoofer, but i did not hear any of the lowest bass while using this gpx555. by way of comparison another system i owned was comprised of some affordable recertified harman kardon separates i.e. a 2 channel receiver for 150usd, two bookshelf speakers for 150usd and a 12 inch powered subwoofer for 150usd and while certainly not spectacular i could at least hear the lowest of the low bass. i am of the opinion that you really cant get a decent subwoofer for under 400 or 500usd so i had no delusions about that recertified stuff, but it was in my price range and whilst it didnt play the lowest notes very loud, they were definitely audible.with the gpx555 i just didnt hear the notes from entire frequency ranges at the low end. i do not know the exact cutoff at the low end where it can no longer reproduce the notes, but if you have ever used winamp and played around with its 10 band equalizer, where the lowest slider is 70hz and the highest is 16khz then you may grasp that what i am speculating is that nothing below say 250hz or 180hz or somewhere around there is being reproduced.for frame of reference i listen to most of my music on a pair of sennheiser hd650 headphones with lossless flac shn or wav source output through winamp and i always finetune winamps 10 band eq into a sort of V shape with the lowest and highest sliders almost at max and then each slider between those two progressively lower such that the slider for 1khz in the very middle is almost all the way down at the center of the V shape.and what i can tell you is that the low notes in these songs i mentioned, those which are below the 180hz (2nd lowest) slider on the eq all hit hard and boomy and sound great on my headphones, and as such i anticipated hearing those notes from the 10inch subwoofer on the gpx555 but they just weren't there. i should point out that when using the gpx555 in this kitchen in addition to the sub optimal placement of the subwoofer, i am also not using a lossless audio source nor am i playing it through winamp and its 10 band eq.everybody just puts on youtube videos which i believe are all manner of lossy, and that flash or html5 player or whatever it is has no equalizer that i am aware of, and of course the left and right audio composite patch cord running from the computer to the gpx 555 is not gold plated, low guage, or nitrogen purged etc etc ad nauseam ad infinitum, ergo these shortcomings are indubitably degrading the sound quality.what i *have* done though, is to make sure that sonys bass boost, which on this unit they call bass bazuka or some inane crap, is turned on, and it does in fact make a very noticeable difference - when it is off there is absolutely no low end at all. when it is on there is a decentish() amount of muddy midrange and high range bass.this unit also has a dedicated control to adjust the level of the subwoofer itself, from 0-10db and i have this as high as it will go. there are also around 10 built in eq presets available which i have tried in an effort to get the bass to hit (you know that feeling you get in your chest when the bass drops) but i still am not hearing the lowest notes.it also has a custom eq setting which consists of only three bands that are not labeled with their numerical hz value, only low mid and high. i have manually set this as close as possible to the V shape i use in winamp with the low and high at max and the mids near minimum and this is the configuration i used to test the songs i mentioned.as far as build quality goes the sony gpx-555 is very plasticky and extremely lightweight for its size. now maybe headunit and speaker technology has changed since the time i picked up that hk stuff, but i was surprised at how light the speakers and headunit were considering their size and cost. maybe the weight of the magnet is no longer a necessary and sufficient variable to solve the equation for quality.all of the controls on this thing are ridiculously oversized, chintzy and not particularly tactile or sturdy feeling. i guess you could say they are all soft touch type buttons that have a lot of give it has a decent size display with graphics that look like something out of an alpine car audio headunit from 1995. the volume nob is the size of a grapefruit for some unknown reason (much too big).the face of the headunit and the cone of each speaker and the subwoofer all have led lighting the color and pattern of which can be changed or disabled entirely. honestly i would prefer it if sony had reallocated the costs accrued by this gimmicky nonessential lightshow into higher quality audio components on the headunit and speakers in an effort to provide better audio quality at the same cost.one of the selling points for us was that this unit was bluetooth and near field communication capable and somebody figured out how to get their phone to talk to it pretty easily so now they can control basically all the settings and choose the music at the cost of their data plan. it also comes with a small remote that is seemingly bereft of a mute button but replete with two aaa batteries.as stated previously the speaker wires are a. too short (i.e. 6ft maybe idk) b. have no speaker posts and c. use a proprietary connector that looks more like an ethernet jack than any else.something else i noticed, and again maybe this is just the way speakers have evolved, is that the actual woofer cones on the speakers and subwoofer do not move at all when music is playing. the cones on every other set of speakers i have owned move in and out in time with the notes and the distance traveled increases in direct proportion to the volume level.all in all i would say that if you dont care about low frequency bass, assuming that my inability to properly locate the subwoofer on the floor in a corner is not entirely responsible, then you would be pretty happy with this unit because it does sound reasonably nice and has plenty of volume, pretty flashing lights, bluetooth, eq presets and a (rudimentary) custom eq, and yes it looks sleek and black and shiny and sexy from the front (the particle board from the rear is a little disconcerting).notwithstanding the veracity of that antiquated adage re breaking speakers in effects an amelioration of thier phonic capabilities (headphone freaks swear by this but i didnt notice anything change with mine) i will be unequivocally verklempt if, after a few weeks of 15 hour per day usage, i throw on some aphex twin selected ambient works and am magically blown away by the earth shattering low frequency bass drops vis a vis richard d. james's irrefuteably gekkenhuis genius. we are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of the dreams. all of these moments will be lost, like tears in rain. godspeed.",Bytannhuser gates,3

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Very disappointed!,"About 2 years ago I purchased a Sony LBT-GPX55 1600 watt stereo system that sounded amazing for the money. A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to buy the Sony LBT-GPX555 but when I got it I was very disappointed. The sound quality wasn't as good as my GPX55 system which would fill the room with bass and it sounded good no matter where you were standing or sitting. The GPX555 had decent bass but it wasn't very deep. But the old system had deep bass. I tried messing with the sound settings and making sure bass bazuka was on and no matter what I did nothing helped. After giving the speakers some time to break in as some call it, I still wasn't satisfied with the system. I contacted Sony and they gave me the recommended settings but it still didn't help. I have a friend who has the GPX555 and he herd my GPX55 and said mine sounded so much better. So he sold his and bought the GPX55 here on amazon. I liked the lights on the new system but I'd rather have better sound then speakers that light up. My GPX55 has lights on the front of the stereo that I think have a more aggressive and better look to them. So I returned the new system and bought a new TV instead. I would recommend the Sony LBT-GPX55 over this LBT-GPX555. I've seen the GPX55 go on sale for 375 many times but this GPX555 only goes on sale once in a while usually for 449.99. The wattage of the GPX555 is 1800 not 1600 but I think 1600 sounds better.",Alexander,

I normally listen to it in the 5-10 range out of 50. It also has two red and white audio inputs on back for multiple added components. I do wish there had been an aux jack as well. The lights are excellent and really add an extra facet to the music listening experience. It has many other features such as DJ synthesizers, NFC, USB copy, Bluetooth, among others.

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Great but a small let down..,"A friend of mine has some SONY speakers that he has had for a few years now and i loved them. I purchased these thinking they would be just as great or better. I noticed that these are louder, but his have a much powerful bass, and half the wattage. Overall these speakers are great, but i was expecting the bass to be a little more powerful, even with the Bass Boost. Great for a party or something though, i'm just a bass fanatic.",Ethan,4

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Great stereo system,I was in the market for a new home stereo system. I had purchased the LG CM-4550 a few days prior. That was a mistake. You really do get what you pay for. That was a very weak stereo with nearly non-existent bass. I had returned the LG and purchased this Sony a few days later and I have not had a complaint since.

Sony,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,Powerful sound but subwoofer is WEAK!,"My old Sony MHC-EC 909iP had the most brutal, wall shaking bass...but the CD player started skipping and stopping all the time so I bought this one. I ONLY use Sony audio because it's the best sound for the price.I was excited as I hooked up this new system and put some music on. While the sound is clear and powerful, the bass is hardly audible. This subwoofer is WEAK, almost like it's not even there! I'm a bass freak and was very disappointed. The salesperson at Best Buy said I could easily hook up the speakers from my old system...WRONG! I'm not happy about this lack of bass but everything else is okay.If you're looking for a system that has good sound and you DON'T need earth-shaking bass, you'll like this.

I have had/installed a lot of different kind of in-ceiling speakers and these by far are the best to install in a room that doesn't have a subwoofer. They produce a good quality bass sound but not enough to rattle the walls. If you want that, you would deffinitly need to add a sub to the room. But for what I use them for which is just music, they are perfect. For the smaller rooms, I would recommed the 6 1/2 which are just as good but just a little less bass.",madever,5
Yamaha,NS-IW480CWH In-Ceiling 8 Natural Sound Three-Way Speaker System (Pair),Awesome Home Theater Speakers,"I recently mounted these speakers in game / theater room. We wanted speakers that were ceiling mounted so they were out of the way and not noticable. These speakers were super easy to install (other than running wires which has nothing to do with the speakers themselves). Each pair came with a template for cutting the hole, had pop out legs that held them in place while you finished mounting them, and spring loaded speaker wire connectors that made connections fast and easily accomodated 14 gauge speaker wire (or banana clips). Once installed they fit flush and are virtually invisible with no annoying emblems or tags on the covers. The sound from these speakers is fantastic.

So I knew I had to buy a pair of 8 inch woofers to satisfy my high standard for sound quality. I was also slightly afraid that for under $200, these speakers wouldn't sound as good as some higher priced models.I am happy to report that these speakers ROCK!!

Yamaha,NS-IW480CWH In-Ceiling 8 Natural Sound Three-Way Speaker System (Pair),Great Surround Speakers - Let me tell you why!,"This is the 4th pair I've bought because these speakers are great. Let me explain the dimensions a little better since the 6.5 might be confusing. The actual hole you make in your ceiling is 10 inches, the woofer is 6.5 inches with the two tweeters in front of it. The great thing about these speakers is that the woofer is angled and positioned within its casing so the woofer speaker can be pointed in the direction to where you are listening. The two tweeters are also adjustable so they can point in the direction of the listener. This is super important to do when installing these, so make sure to point the woofer by turning the entire casing to the desired position so its angled towards the listener, then move the individual tweeters to point towards the listener as well. It comes with an easy card board template for cutting out the hole, so place it on the ceiling and use a pencil to draw the cutting line, just make sure you go in the attic or use a stud finder to make sure you cut the ceiling BETWEEN the studs with enough room for an 8 inch diameter hole. These speakers also have a nice white grill to cover the speaker, put a 3 or 4 of those black sticky things on the edge of the grill and carefully put the grill in the speaker (be sure to take out the plastic insert inside the grill, that plastic insert is just for shipping the product). The black sticky things are to keep the grill from ever falling. When installing the grill make sure not to force it, make sure all edges of the circle go in evenly..otherwise you'll bend the grill. That's it, so super EASY install, great sound... and remember, these take up an 10 hole even though it says 6.5 because they are talking about the woofer. Hopefully this helps anyone installing.",Darin Grey,

I'm of the opinion that it's not necessary to overspend and was looking for a 3-way option that has an adjustable directional tweeter. These fit the bill so I gave them a shot... wow! Great buy and they sound awesome! I would recommend these to anyone in a surround application, but I would definitely NOT use them for front speakers as they are just too small and won't produce enough sound on the lower end because of their smaller size.PS- the construction quality is top-notch and the installation was very easy in my ceiling tiles via drywall saw and the template they gave me.

Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,A decent video camera for the price.,"I bought this obviously to watch my pets. One of them has been digging at some trim and I wanted to see who it was. I have witnessed the culprit and am able to talk with her to get her to stop. I have been using for 2 weeks now, almost daily. When I go to work is my main concern, but have tried even while out shopping, dining etc. The picture has always been crystal clear, however, it does switch between black and white and color. Not sure why but it's not a major issue for me. You can can hear them or mute them, speak with them, check on the room temperature, it has night vision that works in the complete darkness and still get a nice picture. They also will save the recordings for you for a small fee. They give 7 days free. My only dissatisfaction with this product is that you cannot raise the volume on the camera itself and I feel it's a little on the low side. I do know the dogs can hear me when I speak to them. There are 2 holes in the bottom to mount, but the way I would really like to mount it turns the camera upside down and the picture stays that way, it won't right itself. I'm satisfied with this little camera and has done what I need it to do. When I have to be away from the pups I can still check in on them and talk with them. It has actually put me at ease and given me a little peace of mind. I can see that they are doing well, have water, they are playing and most importantly that they are safe and peaceful. My boss made a good point today as well.

This petcam has 800 number to help you and only costs $3 per month to keep movies for 24 hours...you don't have to pay if you don't like... wanted to see how pet took off a shirt and voila!

Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Does the job,It's great to be able check in on the dog during the day to make sure he's comfortable and behaving well. I'd like to see better resolution on the camera but it works well.,Eric,4
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Excellent,We bought 2 Petcam's before this one. Returned the other two- one purchased at pet store. This one was so easy to set up and maintain! You can unplug and move it and you couldn't do that with petstore one without setting it up again. When any questions arose there's an 800 number for wonderful help! Recommend this one highly... ps after purchasing it reviews were read and this was reviewed horribly on one site. One person said great things and didn't understand the horrible reviews either. Perhaps the site was owned by a competitive company to make their competitor look bad. Thumbs up for this one!!!!,Nikki,5

Dr.'s orders required I monitor him at all time as he was very weak and tired. I was able to leave the house to run errands, get groceries etc while I watched every move he made. I can hear every breath, see every move, talk to him, play five different melodies, take video and still pics. It's simple to set up and operate.

I plan to use it as a baby monitor and think it will serve the purpose well, with one or two reservations stated at the end of this review.First the good.1. Setup was pretty easy and was clearly guided by the included manual. Basically setup involves plugging in and turning on the camera, downloading the Motorola app (in my case from the Apple App Store), creating an account, and synching the device. It all worked pretty smoothly and Motorola deserves credit for that.2. I like the monitor interface: instead of having to keep track of a little camera monitor, you view the picture on your iphone or ipad, which is much more handy. To view the camera, simply click on the app you downloaded and the picture pops up right away. The app is simple and easy to use.3. The camera has some nice features, such as temperature display (and alerts), motion detection, a two-way microphone/speaker for communication, photo/video capture, and night vision, all of which seem to work well.But I have a few reservations about its features, particularly for the iPhone/iPad.1. For some reason, the software on the Motorola app seems to differ between the Android and the iPhone. The Android apparently lets you capture photos and video both, but the iPhone app only lets you capture photos -- no video. That being said, my iPhone app still records video *if the motion detection feature is on*, but this gives me less control over when the video starts and stops.Read more",Silvester Percival,4

Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Easy to setup and use. Able to stream audio / video and record as well. Very user friendly,This WiFi camera can be used for monitoring pets or children. It could even be used for home security but it's not safe to put outside because it's not weatherproof. It was easy to initially set up. I had to connect to it with my iPad through WiFi and then download the Motorola Hubble Monitor app and it will find and register your camera. Once it's registered you can log in to the app at any time from any place and view live streaming with audio. The video quality is fair but nothing impressive. The audio signal sounds good. There is usually about a 3-5 second delay in the audio and 1-3 second delay in the video feed. I have had no problems logging on and viewing the video feed while I was away from home. You have the ability to view the video and talk to your pet and you can hear them as well. There is a two way microphone so you can actually interact with them even if you are 1000 miles away during a vacation. If you love your pets like I do then you will probably really like this system. The Hubble Monitor app allows you to adjust both sound and motion sensing levels and it will automatically start recording when it either hears a noise or picks up movement. This option will come in handy if you are wanting to check in on your pet while on vacation. You can view the live video but if they aren't currently visible on the camera then you can look at a time earlier in the day when the camera picked them up. The app gives you a timeline with information that is useful like periods of time that were all quiet or times when it picked up noise. It will also tell you when it picks up movement. When it picks up either sound or movement then it will start recording. This camera also has IR night vision and it automatically turns the night vision on when it gets dark.Read more,Cute Chihuahua,

Was this review helpful to you Yes No","I purchased this camera so that I can watch my cat when I am away from home on weekend get-a-ways. The camera works with an app, called Hubble for Motorola that can be downloaded from the app store. I am somewhat satisfied with the camera due to its notification settings and ability to detect temperature changes and sounds, but unfortunately if I would have known about the plan that is required to utilize some features after the trial period, I would have gone with a different product.I'll start with some features about the camera that I enjoyed: I really like the fact that you can control the notifications to include things such as a preset temperature change, sound detection, and motion detection. I currently have mine set up to notify me of any movement near the camera, so I receive frequent notifications of any movement on my device. The camera can record a live stream or an action shot that is then stored on the app's cloud to be accessed at your convenience. I also like the fact that there is only a few second delay with the live feed, and the two way communication with the microphone is a really good aspect.Unfortunately, there were only two major things that I didn't like about the camera. After a period of 2-3 weeks, the camera is still a live stream video feed, but the motion triggered recording that I was previously enjoying is now only available by enrolling in a monthly plan. Essentially, now I am only getting notifications that include a photo of the motion that triggered the camera. Since my free trial expired, I am now only receiving pictures of my cat, instead of the recorded video. When I go to upgrade my plan, I discover that 30 days of the product features I was previously enjoying would cost me an additional 29.Read more",Sam Clark,3
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Worked For 15 Seconds - Support Out To Lunch,"Below, I'll go into the struggle I had to get this thing setup - an effort which paid off for all of 15 seconds and then the camera went on a vacation never to return. Note: you need to run it in an Android or iOS app according to the Quick Start. The manual does, buried deep inside of it, mention something about also accessing it using Chrome. I used the iOS app. Blackberry, Windows or other mobile OS users don't apply here.After a setup with issues, but ones I dieseled through, I was running. After 15 seconds, the monitor went dark and the app said FW Updating. Presumably the camera's firmware was updating. That took 10 minutes or so.The FW Updating message was replaced with a Offline message. There was no obvious way to get it online again. The manual had no mention of offline in it or the troubleshooting section. I decided to run setup again. The setup seemed to work and the app gave the message Updating for 5 minutes. After that, it replaced the Updating with Offline. I did this a few times until I gave up. Then I called Motorola using the toll free line.I explained the issue to Tiffany. She asked me to hold to give her time to determine if the issue is with the app or the camera. She came back on the line to say the problem is the app but they don't support apps. To support the app, email 'supportmonitorseverywhere.com'. I did. It is an invalid email address. So I'm left with a useless monitor, a lost hour of my life which will never come back and an empty box my friend's cat will enjoy playing with.Now, here are some other issues. The monitor will only work on 2.4 gig WiFi. I had to setup a 2.4 gig WiFi because I run 5 gig here. The app won't run in landscape mode making it a real pain to use on a tablet.Read more",Paul Cassel,

Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,DECENT PET CAMERA,"I had seen this advertised quite awhile ago. Finally decided to buy this when we adopted a rescue pup recently. The camera works pretty good. The set up was very, very easy. This fact alone should be a selling point because so often the instructions are too complicated. The camera allows me to watch my pup while I am away on a very simple, easy to install app on my phone. This set up also allows me to speak to him which is a good feature. The two negatives to this camera (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars all around) is the picture quality is not all that good. Yes, you can see what is basically going on but it is grainy and a bit blurry. Wish it was a sharper image of what my pup is doing. The other negative is that I had to place it into 3 different electrical outlets to get the angle and position that I needed in the room. Each move meant connecting to the internet and going through the whole set up process. There should be some kind of memory for the IP address. This camera should be more portable for other rooms/views. Thanks goodness, as I said, it was an easy setup. I do like it and Home Depot had the best price I have seen. I have not tried the free trial to have the video saved for playback. Still thinking about doing that. I might be purchasing another camera for my daughter's house and her two rescue pups. Worth the price and very glad I bought it.",btdoxies,4

Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Perfect tool for monitoring my stay-at-home-pup,"Using this to keep an eye on a new Boston Terrier, works great!The Motorola Monitor Pet Scout66 is very practical to set up hardware and software wise. I was happily surprised that the cord was extra-long to allow optimal positioning of the camera even if your power supply wasnt near. I used the app for my Android to sync the camera to my home wifi. It was again very practical and easy to follow. It was great that the product provided visual feedback via LED coloring as well as verbal feedback to indicate the successful sync of the camera with the home wifi. However, for the price of the product, I would expect to have better resolution of the camera, it was a little foggy, but the lag time was fairly minimal so there's probably a trade off.

Basically setup involves plugging in and turning on the camera, downloading the Motorola app (in my case from the Apple App Store), creating an account, and synching the device. It all worked pretty smoothly and Motorola deserves credit for that.2. I like the monitor interface: instead of having to keep track of a little camera monitor, you view the picture on your iphone or ipad, which is much more handy. To view the camera, simply click on the app you downloaded and the picture pops up right away. The app is simple and easy to use.3. The camera has some nice features, such as temperature display (and alerts), motion detection, a two-way microphone/speaker for communication, photo/video capture, and night vision, all of which seem to work well.But I have a few reservations about its features, particularly for the iPhone/iPad.1. For some reason, the software on the Motorola app seems to differ between the Android and the iPhone. The Android apparently lets you capture photos and video both, but the iPhone app only lets you capture photos -- no video. That being said, my iPhone app still records video *if the motion detection feature is on*, but this gives me less control over when the video starts and stops. In other words, for example, if my daughter was in her crib doing something really cute and I wanted to capture a video, there is no way I could do that with the iPhone app. I could capture a photo, but not a video.2. There seems to be a significant delay in the picture (about 3-4 seconds), meaning the communication feature is less useful.3. You have to setup the camera on an Android device, or an iPhone or iPad only: you CANNOT use a computer. This presents a problem if you happen to be part of a small demographic that does not have a smartphone or ipad.4. The picture does not seem HD to me -- it looks more like 480p. Who knows how they classify it as 720, but in practice the image is not nearly so good.5. There is no way to save captured pictures or videos directly to your device: they are saved to cloud, and you have to download them to your device individually.I will come back and update this review as I learn the features better. For now, I can recommend this product for most applications, but keep in mind the caveats I mentioned toward the end and purchase accordingly.",Silvester Percival,4
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,"For what it is, a very interesting item. Some caveats though.","As a dog owner, I have often wondered about what happens during times I can't see my dog. What does the dog do during the day if I am not there How does the dog react to various stimuli When exactly does the dog react to the car When I sleep, what is the dog doingWell, I have used other cameras for this purpose, but frankly, that is always a bit sketchy because I have no control over the camera and can't use it in the dark. Needless to say, I was really excited when I saw this camera offered.1. What's in the box: You receive the smaller camera (it is really small - about the size of your palm), plus some instructions and the power pack.2. Aesthetic: This is a functional item. However, besides being pretty small in almost aspect (about the size of your palm), it has a sturdy stand to sit on that you can swivel around, with a microphone on the back that can also be moved quite easily.3. Use:The first step after removing the camera is to get it online with your existing wifi network. This was a task I did not look forward to because these types of items typically will take a bit of doing to get going. Here, you are instructed to download the app for the device you have handy (for myself I used a Ipad) and then start the wifi acquisition process. The camera found my wifi network easily but it took a few tries for it to register completion.Once the set-up was complete, then the camera worked very well. Default settings immediately told me about happening around the camera. This includes both motion and sound. As the app is in place, notifications are sent to your device as often as there is activity.Actual use: I tried this in many different environments and times. Of course, there is a camera on this device and the quality is pretty good, although not complete HD. Second, and for me a most welcome part, is the infrared capability. Yes, actual infrared capability. And after testing this over many nights, it works very well. It even picked up both the occasional moth and mosquito flying around at night. It is pretty sensitive.The camera has the ability of two-way communication though the microphone (you simply hit an icon in the app to talk) and you can also play tunes as well by hitting another icon. In addition, you can take a photo as well if you want (access not yet). I have used the microphone function, and it works pretty well. The camera has provided some real enjoyment and revelation. Different sleeping places, more or less movement that you would think, and some real indications that dogs are pretty pathetic animals without social interaction - they MUST be in a pack for true security).The camera allows you to also watch in real time. With the microphone, you can communicate with your pet. As would be expected, there is a slight delay (2 seconds perhaps)so you have to keep that in mind. In addition, there is a temperature monitor (how cool is that) as well.Server: The app and computer log-in - under the strange and seemingly unrelated name Hubble - provides plenty of access (more on this in bit) - give you a timeline to look up various short (typically just about 15 seconds films of your chosen activity (dog, kid, etc) or more if these is a continued stream of activity. Plus, you can also see when there is just a sound - though it does not apparently record the sound. The timeline is ON a server, which means be careful what is recorded with this thing!Notifications: When this is powered on, the camera dutifully will tell you what is going on at home or elsewhere around the camera. You will receive a constant stream of alerts. Sometimes this is fine, but other times this will drive you nuts. And apparently there is no way at this time to maneuver the alerts to tamp them down. So, if you are in a business meeting, prepare to be driven crazy with the knowledge you dog has moved around. I expect this will be updated with a app update so this will probably be added later.App: The app at this time is pretty basic. You can look at the camera that is powered on and see the timeline of activity. You can simply scroll down and view the desired activity with your app. There is no apparent way to email the clips to yourself that I have found.Issue : The app goes to a cloud server. If the camera records something it shouldn't, then you can simply delete the clip by hitting the screen and a delete icon will appear. The camera itself is pretty inconspicuous, so it would be easy to have this record things you may regret later!The main point is that you must be really careful with the camera and the server. Second is it would be really terrific to be able to email the clips to yourself so you can edit them and do something with them other than just view the server. In addition, one concern I have is that it looks like there will be a charged service for at least some features as there is a plan tab (currently available is just free, however).Settings Again, at this time, the major issue with the app is it has very limited control. Although there is a tab that has settings, you can't do anything with it, and this means you can't control the notifications, for example. I hope this is addressed in a future software update.Overall: I enjoyed fooling around with this camera. The camera and the IF camera are quite sensitive. The microphone, when coupled with the video clips, is quite sensitive. For a dog owner (or cat owner - or whatever), the camera provides an easy, real-time, access through which you can see what is happening in your home ( or wherever that camera is placed with wifi of course). I have some concerns about server access ( I think this needs to be addressed with some further security measures as this is a cloud based service), but overall the experience is a lot of fun.I give this a strong 3.5 to 4 stars based on the above. For the technology given, frankly, the cost isn't so expensive, but it is still something you have to think about for purchase. Yet, if you have the inclination, this is a pretty well integrated product.",Narut Ujnat Enthusiasm is contagious.,4
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Easy to setup and use. Able to stream audio / video and record as well. Very user friendly,This WiFi camera can be used for monitoring pets or children. It could even be used for home security but it's not safe to put outside because it's not weatherproof. It was easy to initially set up. I had to connect to it with my iPad through WiFi and then download the Motorola Hubble Monitor app and it will find and register your camera. Once it's registered you can log in to the app at any time from any place and view live streaming with audio. The video quality is fair but nothing impressive. The audio signal sounds good. There is usually about a 3-5 second delay in the audio and 1-3 second delay in the video feed. I have had no problems logging on and viewing the video feed while I was away from home. You have the ability to view the video and talk to your pet and you can hear them as well. There is a two way microphone so you can actually interact with them even if you are 1000 miles away during a vacation. If you love your pets like I do then you will probably really like this system. The Hubble Monitor app allows you to adjust both sound and motion sensing levels and it will automatically start recording when it either hears a noise or picks up movement. This option will come in handy if you are wanting to check in on your pet while on vacation. You can view the live video but if they aren't currently visible on the camera then you can look at a time earlier in the day when the camera picked them up. The app gives you a timeline with information that is useful like periods of time that were all quiet or times when it picked up noise. It will also tell you when it picks up movement. When it picks up either sound or movement then it will start recording. This camera also has IR night vision and it automatically turns the night vision on when it gets dark. The night vision works well and allows you to get a pretty good video even when it's pitch black out. The range is pretty good too.For the time being this recording option is free but it looks like this will be a pay service at some point. According to the hubble connected website it looks like the manual recording and streaming options will remain free but automatic recording is going to be a paid plan that you will have to subscribe to. There will be different paid plans depending on how long you want to be able to store video on the cloud. One option will retain all recorded videos up to 24 hours. The next plan will retain videos for one week and the last plan will retain videos for a month. This is the one thing that I don't like about this system. This camera has a high enough price tag that you shouldn't have to purchase a subscription in my opinion. I do like the system that they set up but again I wouldn't want to pay a monthly subscription fee.This camera even takes a temperature reading and displays in on your screen. You can even set it to alert you if the temperature goes below or above a certain level. This is another nice option for me because I can control my thermostat in my house remotely through my nexia home intelligence system if I need to.I like this camera quite a bit but I wish it was waterproof and I hope they don't start requiring subscription. Especially considering that there is no warning on the Amazon product page that tells potential customers that they may need to purchase a subscription in the future to get all of the benefits.,Cute Chihuahua,4
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Rip Off Monthly Cost for Monitoring,"Camera cool, Hubble service is a rip-off.I want to record on my home PC and synchronize the files with my Google Drive or Dropbox account, not pay endlessly for a cloud server to monitor two cams.Hubble service must be making a mint!Total money pit",Amazon Customer Bob the Audiophile,1
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Privacy issues,"The camera was easy to set up and the microphone works well.

Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Monitors as it suggests even if you do not record,"We have a single dog who has a tendency to turn rugs into origami projects, bathe in her water bowl, and line her kibble along the floor in a row while left home alone. With the Motorola Pet Scout66 Wi-Fi HD Pet Monitoring Camera, we can observe her and actually talk to her, too. Since we are not interested in remotely recording her or anything, there is no need to pay for the Hubble universe's capability.Having already done the preliminary and necessary Android app download and installation, I was ready when the package arrived.Setting this up took some time because I could not get it to synch with my system. After some time, I achieved success and placed the monitor in a high position to catch most of the dog's action. The camera does just what it's supposed to in a pretty good way. It's not high quality video, but I'm not interested in that, just using this as a monitor. We have not used it on a daily basis, but find it helpful on days when we will be away for longer periods of time or times when the dog is exceptionally antsy.I see no reason this can't be used for a child or any other person for that matter. If you're interested in recording to the Hubble universe, I think they will charge around 3 a month. I'm also very cautious about having the camera display much of my home because I'm a little wary of images being accessed by others despite security measures.",JO,4
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,Still a work in progress for me...,"Between the cats' tendency to treat the camera as a very cool new form of toy (solved by the judicious application of duct tape) and my own struggles to make this work where I would prefer that it work -- on my MacBook Pro, rather than being required to use my smartphone (Android operating system) which otherwise I only use when I'm traveling and that now is beeping alerts at me constantly), this has still to completely prove itself to me as a device.On the positive side, even for a relative technophobe, I didn't find it impossible to install. The wi-fi connection gave me a few problems, and I may yet go back and try to do a complete reset and see if I can't get it running more efficiently (and remove the damn alerts). I have three cats, all of whom were adopted/rescued at different points in time, and who coexist uneasily in spite of having done so for a decade now, and on at least one occasion while traveling I was able to spot a spat brewing in the part of the living room where they spend a lot of their day time hours and avert it with a stern warning. One cat did a backflip in astonishment. Less to my credit, I'm afraid I also freaked out the cat sitter when she came to feed them, reminding her about some medication for one of the cats...Streaming is great, but I'm not thrilled about the idea of paying even a minimal amount for video recording and storage. Cats sleep a lot and just aren't ready for movie close-ups. Add up the sum that Motorola has conveyed is what it will be charging, and that's still the cost of three new books for my Kindle...I'm tempted to try to use this to help with the rescue of four stray neighborhood kittens, if I can figure out how to protect it from the weather and keep it close enough to a power source/wi-fi. In fact, now that I have it -- and I'm appreciating that this has good quality imaging -- I can imagine other uses, as well. Would I use it as an alternative to a home security system Probably not: those are more flexible and more user friendly, based on what I've seen. But if there's a window you like to leave open, or if you've noticed small items disappearing or there's a very location-specific home security issue that you're facing, well, that could work, too.For me, the jury is still out on precisely how useful this will be. I'll be testing it on more occasions when I'm traveling (I work from home) for a few days, and may yet opt to try a reinstall to see if I can get it working with the device that I WANT it to be working on. I don't need constant alerts -- with cats, it's not really an issue. All I really need is the ability to check in now and again to see if World War III has erupted and to intervene, like the Voice of God, if it has, and this may yet prove to be slightly more than I need. Endless videos of slumbering felines Hmmm... Shall report back...",S. McGee,4
Motorola,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,"Good Video Audio, Secure Encryption, But Video Costs Lie Ahead","This Motorola Pet Scout66 Wi-Fi HD Pet Monitoring Camera gives you a good deal for your money right now with everything being free. To begin with the nicely compact Video Camera will give you a pretty good picture similar to HD with it's 720p screen. The camera also has digital zoom, infrared night vision which provided a pretty good picture in a completely black room and even gives you room temperature display and alerts.The two way communication provides ample sound. It's nice when you can both hear what is going on in a room as well as speak to whoever is in the room. Motorola is calling this a pet video camera, but in actuality, this would make a great security camera as well. Can you imagine pointing this inside your door, seeing a burglar and speaking to them I'm sure when you inform them that the police are on the way, they won't hang around too long.To use this Wi-Fi video camera, all you need is a Smartphone or Tablet, and if you want to be able to view also on your PC, you will need at least Windows 7 or Mac OS 10.7, along with Chrome 24, Internet Explorer 9, Safari 6 or Java 7. I have Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 9 and can view everything perfectly. There is a Quick Set Up that literally anyone can do in a couple of minutes. You simply plug the camera in, get your Smartphone or Tablet and download the Hubble for Motorola Monitors App from either the App Store for iOS devices or from the Google Play Store for Android devices. Run the Hubble for the App on your Smartphone or Tablet, follow the instructions to create your account, then log in and you are ready to access your live camera stream.The set up is really a breeze, but should you have any problems, there is a really thorough User's Guide, and if you need more help, there is an 888 number for a live customer service rep to help you. I had a problem with the camera connection, and found the easy fix in the User's Guide. My LED on the camera was slow blinking, but when the guide said to move it closer to the router, it worked perfectly.The important thing I have to tell anyone setting up your App account for this camera is to read everything during set up. I found out while reading that while there is now FREE motion and detection and Alert and FREE In-App Video Recording, it will not always be free in the future. I read that the still photos from the camera will always be free, but the videos will not. Also, as with all things from the internet floating free in space that can be stolen, the photos and videos streaming out there are encrypted for security and can only be accessed through your password, so they are as safe as they can be. But, it seems as though it wouldn't be a bad idea to turn off your camera when you are home though for your own privacy.All in all this is a nicely priced Wi-Fi Video camera with a good picture and sound, and with everything being pretty secure with it's encrypted pictures and your password protection, it's giving you a good deal, but I would love to know when the FREE motion detection and alert and FREE video recording will change to NOT FREE, what will it cost me then This is a good 4 Star Camera, as my still photos will always be free, but if I should want the video of a burglar robbing my home, how much will that cost me Until I know the future costs of the video recordings, this camera is only 3 Stars.",Tante Maren Maren,3

Same cable different color.If I would have bought 16 AWG Monster (the largest they had, but the plastic sheathing on the Monster Cable was so thick that it looked bigger than the 12 AWG wire, and the wire itself looked thick because the clear plastic that Monster uses to sheath their cables magnifies the internal cable to make it look bigger. Wow.) It would have run me over 650. For smaller wire. Savings for not believing the hype600The length of your run should determine the gauge of your wire. Basically, the longer your run, the larger (smaller number) the diameter of your wire.I found the following information on Crutchfield's website that may be of use to those of you who want to run your wire for these speakers.Speaker Wire Lengths (Crutchfield)Distance from speaker to amplifier:Less than 80 feet, 16 Gauge80 to 200 ft, 14 Gaugemore than 200'12 Gauge.I could have gone with 14 AWG at my lengths, but I didn't think it would hurt go up in size.

Definitive Technology,"AW6500 All-Weather Outdoor Speaker (White, Single)",Jury is still out.,"I purchased these speakers hoping to get good, clean sound outside. They are rated for 200 watts each and sounded pretty good in the store. Unfortunately, one of the two failed completely during an outdoor party I had shortly after installing them. My receiver is only rated at 100 watts per channel so I'm sure the failure wasn't due to overloading.

I was reluctant to pay 400 for a pair of speakers, based on my research of many speakers at considerably lower prices, with good reviews.

They sound great and were pretty easy to install (I already had speaker wire run to the patio). It does not come with mounting hardware, so you have to pick up some screws and/or anchors from a hardware store, but the instructions does recommend what to get and how to install based on the type of wall to which you are mounting the speakers. The bracket separates from the speaker and is mounted to the wall first. The bracket is lightweight and easy to handle, so installing was a breeze. Then you attach the speakers to the bracket which was also very easy. I also like that the speakers can be tilted to optimally direct the sound.",Zach,5

I wasn't able to listen to the Def Tech's before purchasing so knowing my experience with Def Tech quality and reading tons of good reviews, I took a chance and ordered. This speaker has amazing sound quality and bass, even outdoors. I have these connected to a Sonos Connect amp. Since the speakers are 8 ohms they're only receiving 55 watts each. Even still these speakers are loud and are a audiophiles dream come true for outdoors. These speakers are a larger speaker, but still tucked neatly under my soffits. Sure these are a little more expensive than the others, but they are well worth the money. If you just want something to make some noise out side, don't waste the extra money on the Def Tech's.

I have been a long time Definitive enthusiast so I had high hopes for these speakers. These speakers do not disappoint!I mounted them horizontally on the ceiling of our patio, which is just vinyl siding covering up the ceiling joists. We added ""studs"" between the joists so we could mount them onto solid wood. I put rubber washers between the bracket and the vinyl and there is no rattling or vibration of the siding. The design of the bracket makes for easy adjustment to ensure a straight and level installation. I mounted the bracket 7"" from the wall. There is not much clearance between the speaker and the bracket so using banana plugs for the wires makes for a tight fit. Connected the speakers to Zone 2 of a Denon 2307, using an Apple Airport Express to play music from our iOS devices. The patio is 30x15 with another 50ft stretching out for the pool area - these speakers fill the whole space with crisp sound even when only using a moderate volume.

Definitive Technology,"AW6500 All-Weather Outdoor Speaker (White, Single)",Live Concert Sound,"I picked up a pair of the AW6500 in a last minute decision. I was at Best Buy for a different reason but decided to take a look at their outdoor speakers. I wanted to listen to them but there was only the AW5500 on display, so the associate that came to help me kicked on the AW5500. Well, IT sounded pretty good, and when I say IT, that's because only one of the speakers was working, but just buy itself it sounded really good. So the associate says that the AW6500 were on sale and I figured if just that one AW5500 sounded good two of the 6500 should be even better. Got them home, hooked them up and hung them on a cross beam in my carport about 2 feet from my house with the bass towards the outside stucco wall so the bass could bounce off of it. I hooked them up to a older Sansui AU317 amp. that has a 50 watt output and then tied my IPod to it, put on some live blues tunes and cranked it up, WHAT A PERFECT MATCH!!!! The sound comes thru crystal clear, excellent highs and the bass is unbelievable for the size of the cabinets. The placement of the speakers really make a big difference too, because of the wood structure of the carport tied into the house, the bass really radiates thru out the carport, especially when I stand in the sweet spot where both speakers can be heard.

Simply amazing speakers that rival the sound quality of any others I've heard in this price range, outdoor or not. I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase and would recommend these speakers to anyone and everyone. Just remember, these are a bit bigger than your average outdoor speaker, so make sure you check out the dimensions here, and be certain that you've got room for them before you buy. Their not huge just big. (Remember, these are sold individually, so if you want a pair, put two in your cart.",A. Taylor,
Definitive Technology,"AW6500 All-Weather Outdoor Speaker (White, Single)",Outdoor speaker and Sub in one! 25 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,"This is the best all-around outdoor speaker I have found, and I have had many over the last half century. I really like my Niles, I like my Parasound, and I like my JBL's, but after adding these in my garage on custom swivel mounts inside the doors, I was amazed at the bass they are capable of producing, and great balance for outdoor sound. I am an audiophile, and have 3 home theatre systems in my home, and have listened to a lot of speakers over the years. I purchased a sub to go with these, but frankly do not need it. If positioned near a wall or corner, the passive oval drivers really put out on the lower frequencies. They can handle a lot of power, but still are efficient... the Definitive outdoor speaker!",Raymond A. James,

I just put these in my boat, after installing a JVC Receiver 2 years ago- and I had put some 6X9 Kenwoods in the back. They rock HARD- and they were just blowing the front speakers out of the water. You could barely hear them. They were Schoche 6 1/2 speakers, and they sounded pretty darn good- for the super cheap price. I liked them. But the Kenwoods totally over-powered them.

I have these hooked up straight to the head unit, and they still sound great. Before I talk about the speakers, I'll tell you about my past experiences with car speakers.I first replaced my front speakers with Kenwood KFC-1665's that sounded much better, but not great. A bit later, I purchased JBL GX602's from Best Buy. I splurged by spending over 100 bucks, thinking that they would sound great, and thinking the 2 ohm gimmick would let them be driven harder. Boy, was I wrong. The midbass was weak and distorted, mids felt recessed, and the tweeter had sibilance (sharp hissing S sounds) that cut into your eardrum and made them practically unlistenable. The speakers are pure marketing - the swiveling tweeters and plus one cone design are just gimmicks meant to make you think that they are worth more than they actually are, and pay 100 for a pair of speakers that sound worse than 40-50 ones. After about 2 weeks of owning them, I brought them back and exchanged them for these bad boys, which cost less than half the price, but sound twice as good. These Alpine's get louder off of the head unit, too, despite having a lower DB sensitivity rating of 88.5, versus 92 on the JBL's.The lows are surpisingly clear and loud, and even on bass heavy songs, have very little distortion. You'll still want a sub, especially if you listen to hip hop or electronic music, but these aren't lacking in the lows. Midbass is tight and hits hard. The mids sound slightly veiled compared to other speakers I've heard, but are still clear and clean. Upper mids are a bit harsh, but clear otherwise, and not at all obnoxious.Read more",Simon,

If you are into the idea that high-dollar speakers are better because they cost more then this review is not for you. I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Montereo Sport (without the Infinity system installed) and the passenger side stock speaker was blown. I decided to shop around for not only for middle-priced speakers but also a brand name that was reputatble.Not only did I get more than I bargained for, I liked them so much, I swapped out the entire SUV!I replaced the front speakers first and did a test run ( I listen to Metal music) and the sound was clean and crisp on the highs and the lows were not bad either. Don't get me wrong, you are not going to hear the lowest of the lows with these speakers but the sound quailty of the bass was more than adequate.I could definitely tell the difference between the new SPE-6000's and the stock in the back. For the price and quality, I decided I wanted to change out the rest of the vehicle. Let's say I am very pleased with these speakers and I do recommend them.

Alpine,"Alpine - 6-1/2"" 2-Way Coaxial Car Speakers with Polypropylene Cones (Pair) - Black",Alpine SPE-6000 Speakers - Excellent Speakers,"I am no audiophile but these speakers are incredible for the price. If you are into the idea that high-dollar speakers are better because they cost more then this review is not for you. I have a 2004 Mitsubishi Montereo Sport (without the Infinity system installed) and the passenger side stock speaker was blown. I decided to shop around for not only for middle-priced speakers but also a brand name that was reputatble.Not only did I get more than I bargained for, I liked them so much, I swapped out the entire SUV!I replaced the front speakers first and did a test run ( I listen to Metal music) and the sound was clean and crisp on the highs and the lows were not bad either. Don't get me wrong, you are not going to hear the lowest of the lows with these speakers but the sound quailty of the bass was more than adequate.I could definitely tell the difference between the new SPE-6000's and the stock in the back. For the price and quality, I decided I wanted to change out the rest of the vehicle. Let's say I am very pleased with these speakers and I do recommend them. My car does not have all the amps, crossovers and bells and whistles but for a good price in my opinion, these speakers were way better than expected.-SuperDave71Memphis, TN",SuperDave71,

You could barely hear them. They were Schoche 6 1/2 speakers, and they sounded pretty darn good- for the super cheap price. I liked them. But the Kenwoods totally over-powered them.

Alpine,"Alpine - 6-1/2"" 2-Way Coaxial Car Speakers with Polypropylene Cones (Pair) - Black",Insanely good for the price,"These speakers are great, bang for the buck wise. I have these hooked up straight to the head unit, and they still sound great. Before I talk about the speakers, I'll tell you about my past experiences with car speakers.I first replaced my front speakers with Kenwood KFC-1665's that sounded much better, but not great. A bit later, I purchased JBL GX602's from Best Buy. I splurged by spending over 100 bucks, thinking that they would sound great, and thinking the 2 ohm gimmick would let them be driven harder. Boy, was I wrong. The midbass was weak and distorted, mids felt recessed, and the tweeter had sibilance (sharp hissing S sounds) that cut into your eardrum and made them practically unlistenable. The speakers are pure marketing - the swiveling tweeters and plus one cone design are just gimmicks meant to make you think that they are worth more than they actually are, and pay 100 for a pair of speakers that sound worse than 40-50 ones. After about 2 weeks of owning them, I brought them back and exchanged them for these bad boys, which cost less than half the price, but sound twice as good. These Alpine's get louder off of the head unit, too, despite having a lower DB sensitivity rating of 88.5, versus 92 on the JBL's.The lows are surpisingly clear and loud, and even on bass heavy songs, have very little distortion. You'll still want a sub, especially if you listen to hip hop or electronic music, but these aren't lacking in the lows. Midbass is tight and hits hard. The mids sound slightly veiled compared to other speakers I've heard, but are still clear and clean. Upper mids are a bit harsh, but clear otherwise, and not at all obnoxious. These shine on the treble - The highs feel very clean, crisp, and clear without being too loud or harsh or having any sibilance. The staging is good, and there feels like there is more depth to the instruments than some car speakers I've heard. The only complaint that I have is mounting - The basket is very thick and wide, and may not fit into some mounting brackets (not included, by the way) without some persuasion.So in short, these speakers are absolutely 100 worth it for the price. However, the absolute most important thing of all is acoustically sealing your door. Since the panels are coming off anyways to put the new speakers in, peel back the plastic weatherproofing material on the inside of the door. Cut out pieces of wood, plastic, or even cardboard that fit over the large holes in the door, and seal them off. It can also be a good idea to cut out a piece of foam to fit between the door and side panel, as it absorbs rattles and keeps the soundwaves where they are supposed to be. Trust me, it sounds dumb, but for 20 minutes and 5 dollars these will go from sounding better than the stock speakers to sounding bonkers, in a good way.",BySimon,5

In the past I've run 100/pair Polks and Infinity's. The guys at Best Buy were pushing these, told me they'd have pretty great bass response when paired with my Alpine deck. I installed them front and rear in my vehicle. I didn't really think the bass was too fantastic, though I haven't ever really been satisfied with the bass output of any of my speakers by themselves- I always wind up adding a sub. Honestly, at first listen, I could tell that these Alpines were a little more tinny, and had a little less presence than my past speaker choices, so I was slightly disappointed. But I should have expected that when I chose to pay less. All of that being said though, these speakers are still a big upgrade from stock speakers. I wasn't unhappy with these speakers, I just could tell that they performed slightly weaker than speakers I've owned in the past. I still drove this vehicle with these speakers for two years, pushed the stereo pretty hard, loved the sound on a whole, and never had any problems with them. Really not bad for 52",BySteve,3

Alpine,"Alpine - 6-1/2"" 2-Way Coaxial Car Speakers with Polypropylene Cones (Pair) - Black",Great Speakers,"I recently purchased a new Kenwood deck for our Suburban. I debated at Cartoys on whether to buy speakers at the same time. It immediately became apparent - the stock speakers could not keep up with the new deck. Cartoys made me a great deal on the Kenwood. I couldn't buy it for what they sold and installed it for. However, the speakers were another matter. They wanted almost twice the price for these same speakers. After surfing Youtube, i found a tutorial that showed step by step instructions on how to install speakers into the Suburban doors. Might not be for everyone but I have a solid background in electronics, wiring, sodering, etc - so it was a snap to install and set these up. I bought the first pair for the front doors. The sound was drastically improved but there was muffled noise coming from the 2nd pair in the passenger doors - so I ordered a second set. Sound quality is now great in the truck (for anyone else attempting this - make sure you disconnect the sub in the back of the truck as it is a stock POS). I may opt for an AMP and new Sub - but for now the sound is drastically improved over the stock radio/speakers provided by Chevy.We recently took a road trip from CO to OR - the cost was so worth it.

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,excellent wireless headphone,"I would actually give these 4 1/2 stars if I could. These are the best headphones I have ever heard from B&W, greatly improved from their closed in, overly warm earlier models. The P7 wireless still have a somewhat elevated bass, but control and slam in the bass region is excellent and the elevated bass does not muddy the excellent midrange. Highs are very good also. Imaging not a pinpoint as the Sennheiser Momentum wireless, but also very good. Superior bluetooth range, and interference when it does occur is not as ""busy"" as on the Momentums - instead of a series of dropouts and digi-noise as on the Senns, I usually only get a simple dropout of signal - much less annoying. Everything is improved a bit in wired mode, the bass is even better controlled, making them less warm while improving slam even more, midrange & highs also improve. Best ear pads ever - very deep and the foam forms a nice seal which is very effective for blocking outside noise (there is no Noise Cancelling in these as in the Momentums). Clamping force is very strong at first (which helps with the seal) which may be off-putting to some. These are excellent headphones, especially for Bluetooth headphones, but I find the Momentums a tad more refined and prefer them slightly to the P7. However, they are close enough in quality that it is a matter of taste I think, and many will prefer the B&W - you can't go wrong either way.",bbbuyer,4
Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,P7 beats Beats,"Being a tech junkie and audiophile, I have bought and returned many a headphone. The B&W P7 I will keep. The sound is true to the recordings. The clarity of vocals is great and the balance of highs and lows lets you hear what the recording artist intended. Too many headphones these days are targeted at kids with thump thump thump bass to an extreme. The P7 has a nice bass but not at the expense of the rest of the sound spectrum.With high quality recordings these sound great. have been listening mostly to rock--U2, Midnight Oil, AC/DC. Short Skirt/Long Jacket is amazing on these headphones.

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,A whole new world for your music,"I've been a pro musician for 37 years and have owned a lot of headphones in that time. I've listened to headphones in the $2K range and higher. I've heard master recordings of known songs in studios. Everyone is different, but let's just say I have some experience with listening and I really can't stand much below excellent quality when listening to music.These headphones are an incredible value for what you get. Not only is the craftsmanship about as good as can be, but there is a detail to the design, fit, and finish that you don't come across every day. You can tell as soon as you test drive a pair that they are exceptional. Crystal clear highs down to thunderous lows and all the mids in-between, this handles them with ease. The P7's do not exaggerate anything across the frequency spectrum from my analysis, so you're hearing exactly what the artist intended. The better your input source, the better the sound, but these can be driven from a second generation iPod and have plenty of volume for those who like their music REAL loud. No headphone amp needed. Period. This is the first pair of headphones that I am doing a burn-in with. I did listen to about 5 songs before anything, though, and they were phenomenal in their reproduction. Believe me when I say if you've never heard your music through very high end speakers or headphones, these will open up an entire new world of sound for your listening. You'll hear things in the mix you never knew were there. Yes, THAT caliber of headphones, and not for $2K.",Gegatso,5
Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,One of the best,"The Bowers & Wilkins P7 over-the-ear headphones are, hands down, some of the best consumer/professional level headphones you can buy. There is virtually nothing wrong with them beyond being every-so-slightly tight fitting.You are given the immediate sense you’ve purchased something special. The packaging is simple, elegant, and compact on the outside. Upon opening the box, the headphones are folded by themselves in a molded case. And what a great thing that is! Highlighting the design of the B&W P-line is essential to the overall experience, as there is nothing like them. Besides the use of high-quality materials (aluminum, sheep’s leather), the metal frame curves around the square-shaped full-sized ear cups in a graceful way. The hinges that allow them to fold more compactly are solid and industrial-feeling. The ear pads are attached magnetically to the cups, and gently pulling and removing them reveals the drivers beneath. The leather padding on the ear cups and head band is soft and thick. And adding to all of this tactile and visual joy is the smell of leather. It compliments the ‘first experience’ with them in a way that I’ve not had with other headphones.Pulling up a small tab on the molded case reveals a leather carrying pouch, a simple instruction manual, and a spare 3.5mm cable. That’s it. It’s simple and encourages one to get on with the reason why you made the purchase to begin with.If you were impressed by the design, the sound is only more so. It’s obvious there was a meticulous amount of attention in how sound is delivered through the P7s. There is a level of detail revealed here that is stunning to hear. Music comes to life in all frequencies of the sound spectrum. Lows are rich and punchy with no overt boom or distortion. Mids are exposed and centered enough to be able to easily hear without inducing ear fatigue. And highs are light, crisp, and full of detail. For being close-backed headphones, the sound stage is surprisingly large and open. There are times where it’s easy to forget you are wearing a set of headphones and not listening to a high-end stereo system in front of you. Part of this is due to how excellent the sound isolation is and part to how superbly well-delivered the audio is.It feels like B&W has gone to great lengths to make the P7s reproduce recorded audio the way an artist, producers, and engineers intended it to be heard. Instrumentation has an extremely high-degree of separation on almost every track I’ve listened to, the exceptions being on those recordings that were not great to begin with. And headphones like this allow for one to hear the extra dimension added from the environment where the recording was made. For example, if something was recorded in a small room, you can hear all of the audible nuances that come with recording in that small space. Symphonic music feels rich, huge and detailed. Rock albums feel aggressive and full of attitude. Electronic, jazz, contemporary, industrial…you name it, these headphones faithfully reproduced audio in ways that continually surprised me. This is refreshing, as it highlights the fact that so many consumer headphones add ‘filler’ to their signature. In other words, accuracy of the music is not the end-goal; selling a certain kind of sound associated with the headphone is. This is fine if you enjoy one or two particular types of music, but the limits become apparent when you go outside of that box.While on the pricey side, the B&W P7s are worth every penny, as they are in a class all their own. From the product presentation to the design to the listening experience, the attention to detail is borderline obsessive and",bulletproofcharm,5

I have had the pleasure to have been in many studios ranging from small home studios, to large professional studios, and these headphones have been the headphones that have made me feel that way. Compared to beats, bose, sony, etc, these headphones are leaps and bounds ahead of them in regards to build and sound quality. There are definitely other headphones that are more expensive and could most definitely sound better, but in this price range, these are amazing. The leather is extremely soft and smells great.

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Sweet Music,I own an embarrassing number of headphones priced from $12.00 to $700.00. I collect headphones and am very critical about what I like.When I first listened to these I was very disappointed and was thinking of returning them. But like some of my headphones they required burn in to reach their true potential. Well after running them through a burn in app they really opened up. The bass became controlled going deep with impact. Mid's are creamy but some what recessed. High's are clean with a bit of sparkle. Soundstage is good for closed back cans. Build quality is excellent with a very impressie style. If you want a pair of headphones with outstanding style backed up with great sound these are for you.

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Not worth the money,"These are very nice headphones, yes. The problem is, there is a lot of competition out there and these don't particularly emerge as winners by a large extent. They are only marginally better than many headphones available especially in the $200-400 price range, but just not better enough to justify their heinous price tag. Build quality is really good for headphones, but then again, build quality of headphones isn't exactly a very high standard to begin with, primarily since many are concerned about weight and comfort vs. durability.I also found the sound to be lacking consistency in each song I played. Some songs sounded brilliant, others mediocre, all depending on the way the music was recorded. I've know B&W to make nearly any song sound amazing in their loudspeakers, despite whatever studio recorded it. These headphones do not continue that tradition. Keep in mind I was using high quality recordings, all at high bitrates and mostly from alt-rock and trance genres.These headphones are impressive no doubt, but NOT for $400. Maybe more for $100-200. In fact I've heard better sound from cheaper headphones, sadly.I am also not a huge fan of the design. Yes it does look classy, but the design has a certain evanescence about it; like in a few years down the road these things will look rather ugly or odd. Just a bit too strange for my tastes. Borderline hipster. I just want an all around good looking headphone that doesn't have to scream about how different it is by its design.Ultimately, I returned them.",MusicBound,3

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Worth Every Penny,"There are very few things these days that are worth every penny. This pair of headphones is one of them. The sound quality is as good as all the other reviews indicate so I won't re-create the wheel. I have tinnitus and sometimes it's difficult for me to hear the TV or stream a TV show or movie without having to turn the sound up (probably why I have tinnitus). I live in a condo and playing music, TV or movies loud is not an option. These headphones help to focus the sound to my ears rather than the whole room let alone the building. I don't have to play them loud to enjoy the sound or hear the words. They tend to get a little snug but not so much as to outweigh the overall sound quality. As for the quality of construction and materials, you get what you pay for. The leather is soft and supple, not plasticy or sticky on the skin. The metal parts are well made and give the headphones a very nice appearance and feel. And finally, I have a big fat head.

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Just Short of Greatness,"I really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but I ultimately had to return them. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through and it's heavier than its competitors for it. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also softer than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. They did feel good at first when I put them on, but I felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them. The clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw, under my ear ache. They seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I came away disappointed. They don't sound bad by any means but they're warmer in the mid range that I like which sacrifices some of the treble that I'm used to. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. That didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, Sony, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's getting close to the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. Most of the bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. On a particularly heavy song, the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my M50X's to remember how much I should be hearing it. The extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation. The P7's made most everything sound better and outperformed my M50X's just not it the rock category which is a big one for me. They came up short according to my tastes. Headphones originally priced at $400 shouldn't have such a glaring weakness. They should do everything really well but don't. That was the main reason why I had to let them go.Outside of music, the P7's also worked well with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable. My M50X's held their own while doing a direct comparison though.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. A drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me. If you've already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's physically head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves.I still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds. For heavy vocals, stringed instruments, and almost everything else, they're still very good. Hard rock is their achilles heel though. I'm just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion. I now have a greater appreciation for my M50X's though. Going head to head against a high end headphone like the P7 and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision, that was the main reason why I couldn't keep them. I just couldn't justify paying $300 for a set of headphones that didn't completely outperform my M50x's, are actually lacking the treble that I like and hurt from the extra clamping force. But they sure are nice looking.",Packman,4

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Audio Bliss and Perfection,"I have owned and tried Sennheiser Momentum, P5, P3, Klipsch 4i, Etymotics, Grado's, Shure's, and more... Obvsoily these are a combination of in-ear, open and closed headphones.Bottom line...I have NEVER had my hands on ANY type of ear/headphone that sounded as good, nearly as beautifully made, and comfortable as these. I would be surprised if they don't wind up in MOMA in NYC like Movado's.Sound Quality specifics...2nd to none instrument/voice separation with close but awesome soundstage, tight and appropriately strong bass, great mid-range, unbelievable and again appropriate highs (again 2nd to none), many people claim you can hear new details with certain gear - with these OH MY YOU WILL, isolation is great while actively listening and does a great job of shielding sound from outsiders.They are so efficient that my ipad and phone drive them as loud as I could bear - amazing for such large over the ear drivers.If you love music and sound at it's best and love to get ""lost"" in it, I know of no better place on earth unless you are prepared to spend well into 4 digits.The only downside...$400 is a lot of money, especially for headphones. However, I can safely say they blow away anything in this price range and they are physically a work of art. Lastly, they smell beautiful, really. Other reviewers have described the smell similar to what the inside of a ""Bentley"" or ""Rolls Royce"". It seems crazy to say it but it is no exaggeration, really.",RyanMG,5

The sound is great; emphatic period.My experience is that they are difficult to adjust for long-term comfort on my head; they require a great deal of re-adjustment.The other disappointment is the frailty of the cords. I had to replace the one with the built-in mic after 7 months. Now the second one is beginning to fail.I don't know if B&W has realized this vulnerability but given the fact that they so readily offer replacements for $24.99 (at last check) it seems that they may. My failed cord was very easily replaced with proof of purchase which Best Buy's retail system faithfully provided.I've got another 14 months' of free replacements then I'll have to pay out of pocket if I wish to use that cord any longer.I regret buying them and would not had I had it to do again.",Secas,1

Easy to discern all instruments in the Bach concierto...just phenomenal. All music in FLAC files. My at home and travel experience after 4 weeks remains excellent.Build quality and design are superb.

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,"Fantastic, but best suited for amp of some kind.","As a bit of an audio nut I picked up these and some C5s at the same time. They both fit the ways you'd expect, with these wanting a much better source than my Note 3, and the C5s shining on either source. The audio on these is incredible on a decent source. On my phone there is good quality, but not the ""sitting right next to a live band"" feel you get when these have the power they want. I'll go more in depth on some particular songs at the end, but first comfort. As someone with goofy large ears and a big noggin, these are comfortable for a couple hours if I don't have my glasses on. With my glasses on, they are a bit tight and very noticeable after an hour and a half or so. The build is fantastic and the case is nice. Very luxurious head phones to look at for sure. As far as songs go, I don't have a dedicated external headphone amp yet, still deciding which route to go, but these were listened to off of my programming/gaming rig which has an Asus ROG motherboard which has a decent headphone amp built in.Make Them Suffer-Elegies: I am a metal head primarily and this is probably my baseline song because there is a ton going on. This song is an atmospheric story telling of how the vocalist lost someone very near and dear to him, his screams, the furious instrumentals, the sad piano, and explosive breakdowns typically put headphones to the test. These pass that test very well. They capture the music in a big way. Every instrument has it's place and the atmosphere is flawlessly created for a heartwrenching experience.Hans Zimmer- The Dark Knight soundtrack is incredible on these. Really nothing more I can say other than if you have ever seen an orchestra perform this type of music in an auditorium, that is how these headphones sound. Incredible.Magna Carta Holy Grail: I don't really like or listen to rap much, but this song is well produced so it's a good test. These wouldn't be the ideal rap headphones to say the least, the piano and JT really sound awesome, the bass is not incredibly powerful, these are very much rock and classical headphones, which is perfect for me, but if you listen to electronic or rap, I would look into V-Moda Crossfades or Sol Reoublic Master Tracks.Overall, if you listen to music deep into instrumentals and singing or screaming vocals, these are perfect!",Eikenator,5

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,The BMW of Headphones,"Man, do these make one heck of a first impression. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also much more comfortable than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. While they did feel a little clampy when I first put them on, I never felt any real discomfort during my hours of wearing them. They also seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I was a little disappointed at first. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. Well, that didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a slight notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether.

This is one of those rare times where getting what you pay for turns out to be a good thing. Highly recommended for music listeners and those who appreciate a little luxury every now and then.*Note: After Cyber Monday, the P7's went up to $350 which looks like their new standard asking price. That still seems like a pretty good deal and keeps them at the top of the heap in that price range.",Pete,5

Ear pads are very comfortable. Clamping pressure on the head is snug not uncomfortable in any way. Of course this will vary so try them if you can. Great grade of sheep skin leather with a great smell to them. The case soft leather. It is unique but not the most protective but good enough. They do not fold flat but to the side for storage keep that in mind. If you want a headphone that will last you many years if not for life consider these.

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Superb Headphones,"I am older (57) and hard of hearing (I wear hearing aids but not when I listen to music). I have two pair of moderately priced ($100 - $150) Audio-Technica and AKG headphones and have never been pleased with their sound quality when compared to my speaker/subwoofer system. Being at a stage in life where I can afford the price point of the Bowers and Wilkins P7, I spent a lot of time researching higher end headphones. I had narrowed down my search to the P7s and the Sennheiser Momentums and then auditioned both at Best Buy. It was a hard choice, but I found the P7s to be a little more comfortable for my noggin. Both of these are a little too bulky and heavy to use while out and about with a mobile device, but I use them only at home. I have never owned a Bowers and Wilkins product but was well aware of their reputation in the audiophile world. If you appreciate finely crafted products, the P7s will not disappoint you in any way. Their styling (while subjective), material choice, and sound quality (again a subjective characteristic) most definitely met and exceeded my expectations. An all around wonderful product.",pillboy,5

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Fantastic cans for a music lover,"Got this set after my B&W P5's bit the dust after 3 years. The over the ear design, and revised driver make a huge difference. I have tested these on a number of different devices, and they definitely would benefit greatly from an AMP/DAC. These sound great with all different types of music, my personal favorite is classical. Bass and sub-base are strong and accurate, but not disruptive. High's are crisp and tight. Mid's are strong but can be muddy at times. Overall, this is the best headphone I have owned. I will forever be faithful to B&W.",tlh1,4

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Beyond my expectations,"I love listening to these headphones. They have a musical quality that just warms my heart. My setup is high fidelity streaming computer audio into an external DAC and then a vacuum tube headphone amplifier. The soundstage is amazingly wide. The bass is full and deep yet sounds very natural. The highs are crisp and clean without distortion. Some reviews have stated that the midrange is lacking, but I don't agree. The overall sound is well balanced and doesn't have any midrange deficit to my ears. I thought the price a bit high, but when you combine the sound quality with the sturdy stylish construction, it becomes a fair purchase. I have listened to these headphones for hundreds of hours of pleasure. They fit my head well and I often forget that I have them on while I am getting lost in the music. You would have to spend twice what these cost to get a higher level of sound quality. Very highly recommended.",Trancedoc,5

Bowers & Wilkins,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,Best Sounding Headphones I've Owned,"The P7's are the best sounding headphones I've ever owned. I personally haven't really tried any headphones in the same category, except maybe the V-Moda Crossfade, but that is $100 less and definitely inferior to the P7's.But, I think there are basically only 2 huge pros:• Sound quality is amazing and pretty neutral with a perfect amount of bass• Stylish yet solid build qualityA few minor cons:• A bit bulky if you're used to smaller headphones• Buttons on the cable aren't the best to grip (they are plastic ""lines"")• Could have included better case and accessories for the priceAll in all, I think you're paying for the sound quality here and you're definitely getting it. Unfortunately, lower quality audio files tend to be more noticeable on the P7's, but hey that's not what you're listening to with these right? Minor cons aside, the P7's sound better than anything I have ever owned or even tried.",HeyItsChief,4

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Spend less on packaging, more on the basics!","DO NOT BUY THESE!I want to preface this review by saying that I have purchased over 50 sets of heaphones over the years, and used 100s of them to listen to music. I have bought and used sets from all categories and pricepoints, including professional musician in-ears meant for stage performance, and those meant for recording studio monitoring and producing records.When I saw this set of headphones for half off, I quickly ordered them. They seemed to fit the bill of what I was looking for, and the reviews were deceptively high. I needed something sturdy enough to handle the work environment, and something capable enough to receive bluetooth in an obstacle laden work area. I spend most of the work day in a laboratory, not at a desk. Maybe this is a suitable product for those whom are allergic to getting their hands dirty.It was my oversight that this set only has 40mm drivers. The lack of bass response shows this, especially at higher volume. I have an extremely capable pair of audio technica ATH-ESW9 that way outshine this set without breaking a sweat.These headphones are also lacking a fwd/rev skip button to move to the last or next track. It is also used to rid your ears of that extremely annoying youtube ad. That is a huge design flaw in my opinion! Ads will not be disappearing any time soon, and my cheap motorola behind the neck bluetooth headphones from years back have this feature! When you place your phone 20-40 feet away at your desk, it is not convenient to just touch the screen and do this manually.I was also disheartened to see that when I set these down on a sheet of paper on my desk, the printed words bled through into the ear cup material. That is something I have not ever seen a headphone do, no matter what color or pricepoint. Whatever dye they use for these must be poor quality, as they are also turning yellow after only a few weeks of daily use.The battery life is longer than any other set in the price point, and was a welcomed plus.The graduated ambient sound monitor is nice in theory, but really is not that noticeable. It is better to just slide one ear cup behind your ear instead.If HARMAN had spent more money beefing up the basics, this set would be so much better than the competition.I will be returning these, as I cannot justify keeping them, even at half price!",JPeterson,2

Expect the white version of the headphones to show wear and tear within weeks, but still work effectively. If you plan on shoving these into a bag a lot, you may want to consider a different product. Even the included carrying case does not truly fit the headphones. With that said, the headphones work fantastically and do have noise reduction settings. Please note the microphones are on the back of the headphones.Anyone complaining on buzzes or odd noises most likely has those microphones covered. I noticed the slight feedback from these microphones while laying a couch and having the headphones pushed into the couch headrest. Still a great buy.",PerAmadeus,4
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Best Headphones I've Owned Thus Far,"Sound quality is to the ear of the listener. What sounds good or bad to someone may not sound the same to someone else. I bought these yesterday and the sound and volume level are great for me. Especially if you use the Apple or Android app to adjust frequencies. I'm far from expert on headphones but I've owned Beats Studio, Bose QC 15, Bose QC 25, Beats Studio Wireless, and Plantronics Backbeat Pro, and to me these top them all in what I require in a headphone. With ANC turned off and the EQ adjusted via the app these have more than enough volume and sound better than all of the headphones I've listed above. As for the ANC (Noise cancelling), Bose beats them but no headphone that I've owned cancels 100% of the noise. I was able to hear voices, fans, lawnmowers, toilet flushes, etc. with both the pairs of Bose headphones I've owned. The ANC on these is about the same as the Backbeat Pros (better than Beats, not as good as Bose). There is a slight hiss (comparable to the Beats and Backbeat Pro) when no music is playing and it does degrade the sound quality a bit but not to the point to say they sound bad. The ANC can be turned off through the app which eliminates the slight hiss and improves the sound quality a bit. So, to me, these are the best I've owned thus far. SUMMARY: Sounds good with all genres of music. (sounds even better with ANC off) ANC is pretty good and adjustable. Minimal sound leakage at high volumes. Comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Good features and easy to control. Can't go wrong with these in my opinion.",MarkSta1969,4
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Returned due to hum, lack of comfort and function","These headphones do exactly what they say, offer superb noise cancellation, with an ambient awareness function that works fairly well (although there is an annoying hum) in a compact pair of Bluetooth headphones, unfortunately that is where my accolades stop.I will gladly take you through my reasons for returning them:1. These did not fit comfortably as either ""over the ear"" (as described) or even ""on the ear"" headphones and the ear cups are smaller than on most over the ear headphones. My ears are still hurting from the pressure on my ear lobes;2. I have owned numerous pairs of noise cancelling headphones, but was specifically attracted to these due to their ""ambient aware"" function, however when I turned it on I got an annoying buzzing sound in my ear;3. While these headphones can be paired with multiple devices, they can only be paired with one device at a time. As a result if I'm watching a movie or listening to music on my iPad and my phone rings I have to take them off to take the call to answer it (assuming I even hear the ring). Other Bluetooth headphones (including ones that cost less) do have the technology to do this.I own and am very happy with a wide array of Harmon products, unfortunately these are not among those.If you have smaller ears than I do and just want a pair of wireless headphones with noise cancellation for listening to music on a single device then these might be for you, but for $300+ I expect more.",MAHNYC,2
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),GreatSound and Value at 299.99,"I used my Bose QC20i as my primary noise cancelling headphones for a long time but became frustrated with the in ear style so I decided to pickup an over-the-ear set. It boiled down the offering by Bose, beats and JBL.I noticed these in the Sunday ad and how they were a ""Best Buy Exclusive"" so I went down to a store to check it out. They have a really nice display that worked which went a long way. If you have been to stores sometimes this is not the case.Before I tried them on I did a quick Google search for some details and it came up with all the of marketing splash, it is all words until you try them out in my opinion. What struck me initially trying them on is the seal around the ears. They are very comfortable on the ears and seal very well. After wearing the headset for about an hour it starts to fatigue the top of the head. Looks like they chose to make the ear the comfortable spot which is fine.The audio sounds great, comparable with the beats in a good way. I am not a fan of the sound of the Bose headphones, they have that Bose sound which is like audio Doritos, always the same consistent sound but never blows you away lol. The NXTGEn Active Noise Cancelling technology is very interesting. Having come from Bose I had very high expectations and I would say that JBL has met those expectations and exceeded them in a few key ways, namely the Ambient Awareness. This feature is cool in that it allows you to hear what is going on around you to a degree based on preference. This would have been perfect for studying with my cohort back in school when you wanted to kill all of the background non-sense but wanted to still be able to hear someone crack a joke or ask an interesting question on a tough problem.I think one of the coolest parts of this product is the app that you can download. I did not even know about it until I Googled it and it makes all the difference. You can set your own EQ, turn On/Off the Noise Cancel and set the level of the Ambient Aware independently for each each with is great. The hearing in my left ear sucks from driving with the window down all the time so it is nice to customize to each ear.I attached some pictures of the app. One of the other cool things which I still do not understand how they do it but it is called TruNote. I guess it measures your head and tunes the headphones for it. I really like this feature as I usually am wearing glasses of some kind so this really helps when they are on. I did an A/B comparison with it on and off it the music was especially clear when I used the TruNote calibration.The built-in mic is okay but it seems like it is too far up on the headset for it to be really legit. It works but I would say that I get better performance from the QC20i hanging dongle thingy.I would recommend this to anyone looking at a 299.99 price range headset that wants great sound and utility. I cannot stress the utility enough the app really makes this headset very versatile, whether for use in the office to drone out the HVAC that always runs or for general listening in any situation.",ryantheoc,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Hard Choice Between this and QC25,"I first started off using Noise Cancellation headphones since I do many long trips from the US to Asia. I first started using the QC15 and then upgraded to the QC25 which I currently use. I was looking for something with the bluetooth option, which Bose does not offer.Then I saw the JBL display in the store and decided to buy them and give them a try.What a night and day difference from the QC25.The sound customization that is available by the app along with the ANC is a big difference coming from Bose. The sound was clean and crisp.I have not been able to test the noise cancellation on an airplane yet, however in a server room it did work very well.The only drawback is the weight difference between the two sets. The Bose is lighter, but at the end of the day, Im going to stick with the JBL.",chenowitz,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),End all solution,I am an audio junky and a long time fan of Harman products. To me audio quality is the most important thing and these have a very wide response range and are actually very clean sounding for closed back designs. Like the title I chose implies this is the only pair of headphones a person should normally need. I have a pair of open back listening for mixing music and I cant fully retire those but this has everything else. And a tip to the uninitiated the noise canceling is nice for noisy situations but the sound quality is inherently lessened but when you want the full quality it is easy to flip it off and its just astounding. Clean high and deep base. Can play my lossless music extremely well Without that narrow sound you get from the run of the mill headphones. As part of the Harman family they make amazing diaphragms and all around quality is well above the other headphones at this price. I have waited a long time for them to make something like this and I am more than pleased just buy them!,Audiofile2015,5

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),$50 headphones for $300,"Just don't. Go with something that at least looks sharp if you have money to blow. These Bluetooth headphones don't come with their own USB transceiver and the microphone is designed for a phone only and won't work with a USB adapter and Skype. The sound is actually muffled and has less depth than my $50 Logitech Bluetooth headset. If you do want to plug them in and use the cord, the cord that comes with them wouldn't reach to my pants pocket and it uses a non-standard connector. The first pair I got bricked when I paired it with my PC. In the end, I returned the replacement because it was such a huge disappointment. I was really looking forward to noise canceling headphones but the noise canceling just adds a layer of random white noise to your music that changes in volume based on the ambient noise. It doesn't seem to cancel anything, it just has this annoying hum that changes volume with whatever is going on around you. I was REALLY disappointed with these headphones. They could have at least made them LOOK fancy...",Danny,1
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Software needs an update,"I was very excited to get this NC Bluetooth headphones, the sound and the Noise canceling are awesome. However, after 4 days of use, the headphones suddenly stopped and became unresponsive that I had to wait 8-10 hours for it to die down and charge it back again.Right after, it worked normally for a short time and it did the same thing again.I thought that this is a rare case of a defect. Went to Best Buy to exchange it, because this NC, Wireless and how it sounds blew away other headphones. However, after 8 days of use of the new headphone, it started to have the same problem again, went back to exchange it and same thing happened.Ultimately, got my refund back and won't buy it until JBL would fix this headphones software.",Kamigawa,1
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Outstanding,"First and foremost, don't buy headphones based on reviews. Sound quality is subjective, take your own music source and go compare headphones in-store. Listen to your favorite Genre/Tracks and allow your ears time to become accustom to the sound with each headset.My requirement were for good quality wireless headphones. I had initially considered the Sony MDRX950's after reading many factorable reviews. Upon listening, these proved very disappointing, the lower range was over emphasized with poor clarity in the mid and high range. Using the same sound source, I progressed to the Bose Soundlink's and the JBL Elite 700.The Bose SoundLink's just didn't seem to work for me. Whilst these felt very comfortable to wear, the build felt a little ""cheap"". From a sound perspective, the soundstage felt confined, leaving you under no misapprehension that you were wearing headphones. They conveyed a definate biased towards the mid and high range, yet lacking clarity and precision. The base response left something to be desiredMoving on to the JBL 700 Elite; These felt more substantial in construction, the ear padding was certainly firmer and whilst heavier than the Bose Soundlink's, didn't feel that way once on. The soundstage was very open, inviting and exhibiting exceptional clarity across the range with a good base response. Turning up the volume, It was easy to become completely immersed in the music and forget I was standing in a Best Buy store, listening to music via Headphones ... I was that impressed.While the requirement was for wireless headphones, I also tried the Bose QC25's which were certainly far superior to the Soundlinks, exhibiting a much clearer sound with better response across the range. Had the Soundlinks performed in the the same way, I would have been hard pressed to make a decision.In summary, if you're looking for a wireless headset, the JBL's are hard to beat... but then again, that's my opinion, go try some and decide for yourself.",MDB983,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with these headphones. When wired, with noise cancelling off, they sounded great. But, when you turn on the noise cancelling, you lose your highs, your volume, and the overall sound becomes, what I can only describe as, muddy. Go wireless, and the sound gets worse. There are very audible artifacts that MAY become white noise after a while, but for $300 headphones are unacceptable. Additionally, these phones can only be paired with one device at a time and the associated smartphone app is mediocre at best.I've owned a pair of Bose QC15s for some time and love them. While you do give up SOME sound quality with the NC (nature of the beast, I guess), the sound is fuller, richer than the JBLs. I guess I'll stick with wired for now.",NYITpro,2
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Good product, price, yet schockingly missed mark","Call myself an audiophile, but I'm really just someone who LOVEs all kinds of music across genres and ages. I've always enjoyed the peaceful isolation of headphones and evolving stereo. With Bluetooth causing less distortion to sound and improved noise cancelling /ambient technology for wireless headphones, I decided time to upgrade and look at the usual suspects. Sony did have a great, great product at 175 but forgive me as I forgotten the number (m770?). Perfect for young teems and college kids getting into music but may misplace....Given their merger with HK (along with their tremendous royalty and resources!!), an already established mid-range brand at JBL, I felt they couldn't miss. Admittedly, their noice-cancelling is truly superb and a leader. Yet, I feel their R&D placed such focus on this mastery that they forgot it's the music we care about!! Very limited range, distorted highs, and embarrassing lows.That said, it's not my nature to bash someone's work, and I'd simply suggest this headphone for someone who just needs a well-built set for traveling and little less cost. Their well-built feel and cuffs are so that your flying companion wont a hear a thing, or simply leave the music off and enjoy that you'r not hear those screaming children, Hope JBL figures it out, there's an opportunity between overpriced Beats (which have made vast improvement to sound quality but not reputation, and Magnolia-line products like Sessenhieser. Ok, I am impatient and embarraseed----I bought the TOL Beats Pro for 379 for a month until I can sell them and splurge for the Sennsenhiers coming out in Jan with supposed unheard quality....and costs =). It's an investment. For the BEATS, I have to admit they have wide hz range, gold drives, >3ohms, and clear vocals. Never thought I'd say that. I'd only recommend themto the right person.

However, these headphones didn't live up to my lofty expectations. I mainly wear my headphones at work and if worn for more than an hour or so, they become somewhat uncomfortable.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Good,I got both the reg 700 and the Elite 700s during a flash sale so I got a really good price. I got the Elites for 200. If you can find them for that then I think they are really good. I wouldn't pay 300 for them though.To me these fit differently than the reg 700s. The cups don't come down as far as the reg 700's. The openings seem smaller as well. Just go to Best Buy and try both of them for yourself.I have done a critical listening comparison with the reg 700 vs the Elite 700s. But just casually listening between the two I really can't tell the difference between the two. The active noise cancellation def makes the headphones plays softer. Turn it off with the app and it plays louder. The app really sucks by the way.These are bulkier looking on your head than the Beats if you care about that. Can't say they are better than Beats or Bose. Sound quality is very subjective. Just try them all and see which one sounds better to you with music you like to listen to.I just bought these because they were 100 dollars off.

Upon his glorious return, he said theyd received other calls and further knowledge on compatibility with the AppleTV was pending. I asked what that meant exactly, the response was the engineers were in a hurry to launch the headphones and might have made mistakes by using a non-standard version of Bluetooth. As I purchased these during a short $100-off BestBuy holiday flash-sale, I asked if this would at some point be corrected with a firmware update  the answer was you can try and if it works, then yes.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Stellar All-Rounder,"Following in the prestigious heritage of the Everest line from JBL, the Elite 700 sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones. Though not a new type of product, in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well-rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios.The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents. The Elite 700s is nicely presented in a cut out. Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located. This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection, as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage. Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps. Beneath the box is the one button standard 3.5 to 2.5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies. Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and/or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware. Lastly, we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation.The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly. Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate; however, the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use.On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3.5mm input jack, the micro USB charge and sync port, as well as the built-in microphone. Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button, which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom. Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button, the play/pause, answer/hang-up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button.The Elite 700 has a companion app, which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store. Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive. You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you. It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low, medium or high or off. You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own. Moving back, you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger. Lastly, you can activate TruNote, which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum, and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it. The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be. I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured hey, I have a 30-day return window, whats there to lose? Well, these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential. The wireless mode alone is simply excellent. The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution, but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven. The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25, but not quite there. With ANC off, these sound great. Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance, I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response, but in stock, they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm, very slight. I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off, the bass is tight, quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass. It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V-MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease, but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless. The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open, clean, articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone. No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity, none. Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick, it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers & Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2. For a wireless headphone, this is honestly quite amazing. When the Elite 700 is wired, they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity. From the stellar 15-23 hour battery life, to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list.",Danny,5

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Very very disappointed.,"Wireless Bluetooth Noise cancelling headsets? Yeah. It was my unicorn. I was so excited when I first saw these. Search the net for reviews... not many. It's a Best Buy exclusive, so no other sites carry it.Read the reviews here... Most are very positive. Few negative ones. All in all, not enough to dissuade me.So I bought them.Let the disappointment begin.First, the Packaging is horrible. it's almost impossible to open the box and take everything out without at least tearing some of the paper off with all the tape. Not a huge deal... but for high cost items, I like to try to keep in intact.Next packaging problem: How to take the headphones out. Turns out there are 2 small clear plastic pieces of adhesive right over the metal on the band. Couldn't tell it was plastic to be removed until I had to force the first one out.Ok. Frustrating but, not a big deal.The ""quick start"" documentation is pretty horrible. They show you the buttons, but they don't describe what they are for.. Maybe I""m not aware of the ISO symbol for LED or for the ""Smart"" button.Finally turn them on, and they went into paring mode (white/red LED flashing). Search on my phone. Nothing. turn them off, turn them back on.. same thing. Manual doesn't describe what the various flashing lights mean (both LEDs flash white? Red LED flashes twice?) Finally I resorted to their website. Found a FAQ on how to pair with a new device (Power button for 16 seconds). YAY. IT finally pairs.I anxiously fire up my Google Play Music app to hear music. The first 5 seconds it crackles, pops, and drops out and back in. After that, they sound pretty good.. Maybe it was just that start up. Hit the next track button. Same thing. First 5 seconds are horrible, then it settles down.OK.. Maybe it's the app. You Tube. Same problem (if not worse).So, now getting annoyed. $300 headphones and all these challenges? Maybe it's other cell/wifi traffic that's interfering. So, go into airplane mode, and turn on ONLY blue tooth. Crackle crackle drop crackle.So, last ditch effort, I decided to see just how good the ANC/Ambient noise was. So... No music. Just changed settings for the ANC. The room was already reasonably quiet, but I put on the TV with talking just to see how well it filtered it out (just like a chatty plane passenger might be). Switching between the 3 levels, and turning them off, I could hear a difference in the tone quality, but between off, and max, I couldn't tell as much difference between them. Not like my Bose headphones were NOTICEABLY muted the first time I turned those on (wired, not Bluetooth).Lastly, when reaching for the ""smart"" button, I bumped the micrphone right near that button. It was a very pronounced mic pickup. If I was wearing a coat with a hood or something, it would constantly interfere..I've paired my Nexus 6P phone to multiple speakers and headphones, and never had any of these issues. Tomorrow, these go back. I would spend HOURS on the phone with support trying to address all these issues. And I'm not going to sit here and hope for a firmware update.All in all, I was very disappointed in these headphones. A friends Beats headphons (no ANC, just BT/over the ear) were much better from a refinement perspective. Hopefully over time, JBL/Harmon will improve both their documentation and their software, and their headphones. But for now, it is very much a ""first version"" type of headphones... not something that is worth $300...",DPmi,1

I have tried the beats studio wireless headphones and they just didn't do it for me. I understand people enjoy the beats by dre headphones, but I just felt they were lacking..in the sound department .The Jbl Everest 700 Elites were awesome when I tried them. Very comfortable headset, good battery life and quality sound. Very well balanced sound. What I love also is the myjbl headphone app that pairs with your headset. It gives you more control over sound quality.I would definitely recommend these headphones for someone looking for Bluetooth and noise cancellation who does not want to settle for Beats.",CF90,5

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Great wireless headhones,These headphones are great. I love them because the noise cancelling is pretty good. You can't really beat that.

Battery life is pretty great as well.,Thefeelstrain,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),JBL Everest elite 700 is rock solid,"I purchased these after a sad loss of my Executive Beats by Dre. I was in the market for something better in every way. I do believe the Everest has done that. The wireless part is awesome I appreciate the freedom of movement. Also the noise cancelling is on another level, I frequently travel and study in public places so I needed good active noise cancelling.",MMac,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Best Available,"I have had the JBL Everest Elite 700 for a few weeks now. I tried the Bose Soundtrue, Sony XtraBass, and Beats Studio and neither one could compare to the sound quality of the JBLs. The app works well and adds to the overall sound of the headphones. As of right now these are the best I have found available at Best Buy stores.Sound:I listen to a wide variety of music from rap to metal and everything in between. They have sounded great with every genre I have thrown at them. The bass is very clean and crisp not overpowering or drowning. The mids and highs are also excellent. The one problem I find with most headphones is the overall volume being too low. With these I find my comfortable listening level at only 1/2 the total volume instead of at full volume like the Xtra bass and Bose. The Beats were plenty loud but still did not sound as good overall. I purchased the Sony Xtra Bass because they sounded great in the store display but when I got them home it was nothing like in store. On the other hand, the store display does not do these headphones justice. They sound much better than the display units.(The sound quality does take a hit when you plug them in directly to a device but not enough to take anything away from my rating.)Bluetooth:The range is excellent. I can leave my phone in one room and move around the house from room to room completely with little to no drop off. I have not tested the distance with a clear line of sight but I'm sure it's as advertised. They only pair to one device at a time but I have not had any issues pairing with my iphone or computer.Noise Cancelling:The passive noise cancelling alone is pretty good due to the thick padding in the ear cup however, this pair of headphones has active noise cancelling which work very well. I can easily drown out the sound of the kids while they play just dance in the same room. This is my first experience with ANC so I really don't have anything to compare them to. I do not get that bluetooth/noise cancelling hum that some have referred to in their reviews.Comfort:The JBLs are very comfortable with their large ear cups and soft padding. They take a adjusting to find that perfect fit but once you find it you are good to go. I have done about four hours straight while doing homework and they have been awesome. They don't get hot and do not cause sweating either.Overall these headphones are a little on the heavy side but that by no means is enough to take away from the comfort and what these headphones can do which is produce awesome sound.",NewJBLFan,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Too tight. Speakers sounded cracked.,"Had to return. Heavy,tight and if you touched the area around the Mic, it made the speaker sound like it was cracked. Very annoying. I did like the sound of the speaker, when listening.",Hiya,3
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Quiet but hard on the head,"Nice and quiet on airline flights with or without the noise cancelling turned on.Bar on top of head was uncomfortable and I was not able to change the earphones so that it was less bothersome. Cushioned ear phones are nice but become a bit uncomfortable after several hours of wearing them.Noise cancelling feature of turning itself off after not being used for awhile is a great battery-saving feature not available on other earphones that have batteries.Carrying case is nice feature to have, and folding joint on earphones allow you to easily fold up the earphones to fit in a smaller space.",wags,4
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Superb quality, convenience",Sound quality and comfort are the top qualities. The most functional fun is the adjustable ambient noise level with the button or through the app on your phone!I'm so glad I finally splurged on a top-shelf piece of equipment.,ShaneRoe,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Good headphones but a bit clunky,These were certainly good headphones and the noise cancelling was awesome.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Critical management app does not work on Android,"There is no way to manage the features of this headset because the app doesn't work and hasn't been fixed for months. Here's the full story: At the Best Buy store, the JBL rep bragged about all the cool features and technology included, and how you control it via an app on your phone. I purchased the headphones but upon setup I discovered that the App gets stuck with a ""Please connect headphones"" screen. I tried both bluetooth and wired connections. I cleared app data and uninstalled/reinstalled. Nothing helped. On the App Store there are over 200 1-star reviews dating back months complaining about this same issue. How can JBL leave such a major issue unresolved for months? Without the app you can't turn on noise cancelling or any of the features. JBL, you should do better than that!",Daniel,1
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),excellent headphones,These are amazing. You can set the level of residual noise you hear.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),These are NICE !!!!,I read reviews prior to purchasing these for $249.99 at Best Buy and downloaded the JBL application which helps tremendously. The ear cushions surround my ears at a perfect fit and the sound is great in my opinion. I had some Beats but those required a battery at all times which was a bummer for me. If you didn't have a battery for the Beats headphones you were not able to listen to them at all. These have a rechargeable battery so as long as you keep them charged they'll be good to go.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),better than Beats?,"So I researched headphones before I went to the store. I narrowed it down to Beats studio and Bose sound link wireless headphones. I previously owned a pair of Skull Candy platinum wired headphones. The sales guy at the Brooklyn store suggested that I go with the JBL Everest Elite because I told him I mostly listen to music/movies while traveling via airplane. Selling points of these headphones are the app so you can customize the sound (voices for movies, or bass for music) and the ambient noise reduction. You get a pretty good range on them and the battery isn't bad at all. They come with a carrying case and extra cords (charging, aux, etc).My conclusion is yes they are better than Beats.",twiggie54,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Best headphones I have ever bought,"Now, I consider myself an audiophile who always has to have the best sound. I also get really tired of chords, so I started looking for Bluetooth headphones. I was pleasantly surprised by these. I take them on a walk every day, and they cancel out all outside noise with active noise cancelling--I can even block out unnecessary sounds like my mother yelling at me! Because it has active noise cancelling, there is a somewhat shorter battery life, but I can still get a good 6-7 hours out of it on a charge. They do take a little while to charge though, one hour of charge time only gets 40%, but I can charge them while I sleep, so no big deal there. Where these really shine is the excellent bass and studio feel, makes you feel like you're right in there as it was recorded.",ZitiDubz,5

In order to use it on multiple devices the wireless has to be disconnect on all the other devices but the one partnered. It has a long wireless use time before requiring recharging.Issue: the headband for some reason puts an uncomfortable amount of pressure at the top of the head where the band rests on the head. I have experienced inner ear pain from the ear pads with prolonged use (more than two-three hours at a time). I guess the seal of the ear pads creates pressure on the ear. Suggest limiting duration of wear to prevent discomfort on the inner ear and where the headband makes contact with the head. Otherwise the product is great when competing devices are on and you want to hear your program.",1776Cincinatus,4

Sound is excellent, comparable to the Bose, but significantly better than the Beats, Sony and Skullcandy. The JBL app lets you fine tune the headphones to your liking and is very user friendly.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Good, but not great","In theory, these are a really great set of over-the-ear headphones. They combine wireless BT connectivity with the option for wired, active noise cancellation with Ambient Aware' (let's you let in a certain amount of outside sound), a cool sounding built in 'calibration' technology, and it's all made by a well-respected brand name in audio. In execution, it doesn't quite live up to what I would have expected for $300+ There are better (and less expensive) options out there. They don't sound bad and the build quality is great. But I'm of the opinion that they aren't worth the price.First, the good. They're easy to set up and pair with your device They are solidly constructed. They are fairly comfortable (initially) for how heavy they are, and the ear cups are contoured nicely for a better fit around your ear. Out of the box they sound acceptable, and once you download the app and tweak the EQ, it starts sounding much better (especially once you turn off the noise cancellation).But there are so many little annoyances.These are not something that I'd ever choose to bring out in public. For being a wireless mobile device, they're really bulky. They don't start off uncomfortable at all, but they get there after about 30-45 minutes of use. You will notice the heat and, if you have a sensitive head, crown pressure.JBL Harman touts a technology called TruNote that supposedly analyzes the position of the drivers in relation to your ears, making the sound better due to personalization. This is run through the app. You put the headphones on, run TruNote (which plays one quick tone similar to an Audessey auto-EQ setup on a Denon receiver), takes a few seconds to calibrate, and then moves on. I cant say that I noticed a dramatic difference between when I ran it and when I didnt.Speaking of the aforementioned app, you have to download it in order to optimize your listening experience. It allows you to do several things, including running TruNote, turning noise cancelation on/off, and tweaking the Ambient Aware & EQ settings. The one that will likely get the most usage is turning the noise cancelation off and tweaking the EQ.Note I said turn noise cancelation off. The sound quality improves fairly dramatically with it off. In my opinion, its average execution of noise cancelation, so its worth it to have off. The ear cups provide ample noise isolation as it is, but if youre going to pay for noise cancelation, you should be able to use it without affecting the sound negatively.The EQ is where youll get the most dramatic performance increase, as it allows you to adjust 3 bands each (total of 9 bands) within the low, medium, and high frequency sound spectrum. In fact, I would say this is absolutely essential in order to get the most out of the headphones. As mentioned earlier, they sound acceptable out of the box but lack some kick out of the bass and the mids start to get tinny when increasing the volume. There are 3 presets and then you can customize and save different personal settings. I like all of this in theory. Different EQ settings for different types of music is great, but objectively, a common listener may not want to mess with thisespecially since you have to open the app every time to do this. And to be clear, you dont HAVE to open the app to get the headphones to work; but you have to open the app to take advantage of the noise cancelation, the EQ, etc.Its great that you can use the headphones wired when they run out of power. This also increases the sound quality. But what happens when you want to use them wired AND still have power AND want to use the app (to have access to the EQ)? That does not seem possible. Once you go wired it defaults to shutting off the bluetooth connection. And if you reconnect it defaults to sending sound wirelessly.When youre not listening to music you can use the headphones for phone calls. Call quality is average.Finally, its worth mentioning a couple sets of controls on the back of the left and right cups. On the left there are volume controls + play/pause. On the right there is the Bluetooth power/connect button and a smart button that is assignable (via the app) to either adjusting the level of Ambient Aware (low, medium, high) or noise cancelation on/off. These are great and convenient additions, but you have to keep in mind that when you need to adjust the headphones on your head (and you willsee the previously mentioned uncomfortable after extended use comment), youll likely hit these buttons. Its not a big deal, but it requires some behavior change.All of these small annoyances led me to a return.I understand that these are supposed to be more professional / higher-end headphones for people who also want a wire-free experience and mobility. But somewhat complicated, unintuitive, and unnecessary features should not outweigh the primary goal, which is mobility. The bulky design and weight would immediately disqualify them. And the fact that you have to do some work to get them sounding right takes them even further out. If you're an audiophile, your primary use is at home, and you just want a pair of wireless headphones (because as an audiophile you are likely using wired connections all the time), these would probably work (though I think there are better options). These are not a great option for a common listener, as you likely want to just throw the on, connect, and go.",bulletproofcharm,3

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Great alternative for non-Bose lovers,"The overall feature set of these wireless nc headphones is what sold me on them and they were $100 less than Bose.

The JBL app works great on my GS7 to tweak EQ settings as well. Not as light/comfortable (much more bulky on your ears) as Bose but their new wireless nc headphones have way too much bass for my taste (JBL's have better mids and highs too) and I didn't feel the ""pressure"" sensation on my ears with these JBL's like I did with the Bose either.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),IMPORTANT,"I'll get right into it.PROS: Sound Isolating (Also know as Passive noise cancelling)Active Noise Cancelling (ANC)Ambient Noise - Allows you to hear a bit of background noise, a little, lot, or none at all.Comfortable - Snug FitAPP - The JBL my Headphone app has 2.7 rating on App Store...You must be thinking, is this app really that bad? Could they have failed this hard? Well, the answer is yes and no. If you know how to use the app corectly, it is very useful and improves the quality of music tenfold. Jbl doesn't make any of this crystal clear; first off, the app ONLY works for the elites, and I'm told the reflects as well, have only tried the elites with the app. Second, for the app to recognize your headphones they MUST be connected through Bluetooth. Not the aux cable. If you are wanting to utilize the app through a wired pair, then I'm not really sure why you picked up a wireless set of headphones. Also in order to connect through Bluetooth wirelessly, the aux cable cannot be plugged into the headphones. The App is 4.8 stars for me. Improves the quality of music, and people who have given 1 star rating don't understand how to use the app. CONS: So far, not many. I will, however make you as informed as possible. The Fit - Headphone comfort varies from person to person, but to me they are very comfortable and snug fit. They do press on your head a bit but I prefer it, better passive noise cancelling against background noise. Size - They are a bit big, but they do fold up, and they come with a case as well. When Wired: When the battery is dead, the headphones still work with a wire (included), the App does not work, nor the awesome features of the headset. Sound goes to mediocre. Could be better, but I rarely plug them in because of 18-20 hr. battery life. Overall, 4.8/5 starsHope my review helps you make a decision for the better. Feedback is welcome, and appreciated.",Dave,5

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),These are *literally* the best.,"These headphones are literally the best thing I've ever put on my skull. I absolutely love them, because every feature works flawlessly. ANC is VERY close to the level of Bose QuietComfort, and the awareness feature is extremely useful in an office setting or when you need to be alert. Sound quality is spot on, and I prefer the sound balance over any other headphone offered at BestBuy. I read a lot of reviews comparing these to the most expensive Beats or Bose, but I don't understand how the others even stand up to these. These sound MUCH better and are more comfortable than any pair of Beats (which are too punchy and hurt my ears physically and audibly). The JBL's also sport many more features than any pair of Bose (which mainly competitive comfort and their top notch ANC).These headphones are really in their own class, because they are PACKED with features, have excellent sound quality, especially with a little tweaking using the app, and they look classy unlike other overpriced ""Transformer-esque"" headphones. Below are the reasons why I bought these:-Stable Bluetooth-Active Noise Cancellation-Adjustable awareness-TruNote calibration-Handsome design-Extreme battery life-Foldable-Has its own app for mobile (which malfunctions occasionally on my 3-year-old phone but works fine on a newer one)-Are soooo comfortable. I can wear them for hours, and I have very sensitive ears.-The ear pads can be replaced if they wear out, which ensures a long life of use.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Excellent job JBL/Harmon!,"My target was an over the ear headphone with noise cancelling + wireless/Bluetooth capability for around $300. Choices were quickly pared down to the JBL Everest Elite 700, Beats Studio Wireless, and the Sony MDRZX770. (I would have liked an option from Bose, but apparently they don't make a wireless headset with noise cancelling; it's either or.) For me, the Beats are well built and ergonomically acceptable, but the sound is simply too colored. The Sony was a slightly cheaper option, sounded ok (not great), but I wasn't thrilled with the build quality. For me, The JBL was the clear winner. Great and relatively neutral sound, very comfortable and ergonomically designed. The JBL Elite 700 paired up with my Samsung UHDTV and HTC One phone without a glitch, and with no lip-sync issues. The JBL software for Android, while not necessary for operation, worked as advertised and provided for a few nice additional features such as preset and/or customizable EQ. The defeatable noise cancellation was very effective (though not quite as good as Bose provides), and the adjustable and defeatable ""Awareness"" control, which allows you to let varying amounts of sound (phone, doorbell, car horn) through is a really nice feature. And yes, the headset can be used ""wired"" also, should you wish to conserve battery time. All in, this is a very well thought out headset and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The only improvement I can think of would be a hard shell carrying case. The supplied case is ok, but soft, and might not be sufficient protection in certain environments.

However, the construction is bad. The leather covering the foam on the earpieces has come loose and is falling off. I've never dropped them, and only use them a few hours a day, so there's no reason this should be happening. It doesn't make them unusable by any means, just VERY unsightly.",Ryndael,2
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Good sound but heavy headphone,"I was looking for a wireless over-the-ear headphone with a high quality sound rendering then I went to try a few at local Best Buy store. I tried nearly all models available in demo to find that the JBL Everest Elite 700 had the best sound to my ears. As the in store demo songs are not of my taste, they are all chosen for the bumps/beats/oohmph and the voiceless shouting singers... I used my iPod to get some decent music and the JBL was the only one to sound natural to me with no overwhelming basses and highs. The mids were average, it sounds like something is missing in the mids...The ANC is the most annoying thing in these wireless headphones as it muffles a lot the music but a good point for this model is that the ANC is not as strong as the Bose quiet (I could not cope the white noise of the Bose models) and best of all, it is possible do disable it via the JBL app or the press of the smart button once programmed.Another drawback is the weight of this thing, it is very heavy for a headphone and the ear cups are too small which brings some discomfort on the long run.I do not know if my headphone has an issue but I could notice very strong and annoying scratch noises when using the headphone outdoors with ANC on while weather was a bit windy. Disabling ANC removed the issue.The JBL app is a must, it is easy to use and most settings are available at hand: trutone setup, noise cancel, ambient awareness power and balance and the jewel... the EQ settings. 4 default settings are available: Off, Jazz, Vocal, Bass + the possibility to create our own EQ settings.The smart button can be programmed to act as ANC on/off or ambiant awareness power via the app which is very convenient.The app provides also the possibility to upgrade the firmware of the headphone via bluetooth which is convenient even though I wished JBL discarded some information about the upgrade itself (what does it fix/bring?)Regarding the pouch provided, I wished JBL gave some information as I discovered by accident that the headphone can be folded inward to fit the pouch.",Thierry,4
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Amazing Sound and Really Comfortable,"I travel a great deal on airplanes and had been given a pair of Beats Studios by my employer as a gift a couple years back. The ear cups on the beats and the battery were failing so I decided to look into a new set of headphones for the plane. I never was a huge fan of how the Beats sounded, but the noise cancellation was decent and, on long flights, I prefer headphones over my custom earphones. Now, having the JBLs, I realize that the Noise Cancellation was very poor on the beats, and as I said before, they really didn't sound that good.I really love my new JBL headphones! the sound quality rivals my favorite cabled headphones, my Shure 440s/840s(depending if I want the hyped bottom end), and the fact that they are wireless makes them so much less cumbersome on flights. (they will function as cabled phones also if the battery dies, just no noise cancellation. The Beats would not function if the battery died.)If you are looking for a superb set of phones with great(even adjustable) noise cancellation, I highly recommend the JBL Everest Elite 700 series. Amazing buy!",ETheP,5

Not on the level of a set of Bose headphones but for the money more than good enough and how I'm using them.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),OK quality but had audio issues,"I used these headphones connected to my PC via a Bluetooth dongle. 95% of the time the sound is great, no issues. The other 5% of the time I had audio issues where I would get what sounded like the Bluetooth dropping out (crackling, scratchy audio) and time distortions where I would lose parts of the what I was listening to or watching and it would slow down or speed up to catch up. When connected to a PC directly via the included cable, sound was great, never any issues. But that isn't what one purchases expensive wireless headphones for.Also, the ear cups didn't seem to give enough room, my ears were often sore, and the band across the top of my head always left the top of my head sore because it wouldn't open any more. (My head is of an average size, in the Goldilocks zone, not too big, and not too small)Brought these back, and upgraded to the Bose Quiet Comfort 35's. Definitely a little more money, but the difference is night and day.",Kipp,3

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Based on the use from a professional DJ,"Please do remember that this review is based on the use from a professional DJ and not your normal Audiophile. Now with that statement out of the way I was not very impressed with my overall purchase of the JBL Everest Elite 700 Headphones. There are some features that I did enjoy having, but there was a lot more that I was not very happy about.JBL Everest Elite 700Well start out with the positives about the JBL Everest Elite 700 headphones. The headphones them selves fit very snug on my head, but that also might very from person to person. Very comfortable to wear during a 4 to 6 hour event. They turned out to be lightweight even though they are a larger size of headphone. I really enjoyed the perfectly sculpted ear cushions. They cup the ears perfectly and block out most of the ambient sound.The JBL Everest Elite 700 features Bluetooth 4.1 and connects with ease every single time. The Bluetooth allows you to use the headphone built-in media controls on the edge of the left ear piece. JBL has also allowed use of the built-in microphones for hands free calling when paired with a mobile device like a BlackBerry, Droid, or iPhone. Now if you dont want to use or cant use the Bluetooth feature they do come with a 3.5mm jack cable.JBL Everest Elite 700 is also powered by a built in rechargeable battery that will last 15 amazing hours, so there are no worries about running out of power mid set. They charge up with the use of a micro USB port on the bottom of the right ear cup. The JBL Everest Elite 700 has built in auto off sensors to preserve that amazing 15 hour battery as well.JBL Everest Elite 700Now onward to the nitty-gritty. JBL has packed them with NXTGen Active Noise Cancelling. Its a cool feature and concept, but as for DJ use its not needed and if you get the basic JBL Everest 700 it can save you $100 USD. When spinning with this feature on I did notice the headset speakers bottoming out. This made it very annoying when trying to pick out specific sounds during a mix.I feel like the structure of the JBL Everest Elite 700 could have been a lot better. Spending $300 USD on headphones they need to feel like they will last and not snap apart when you take them on and off. JBL might have done this to gain the lightweight feel or just to save money on construction. If I used these for one tourist season outside everyday I dont for see them making it all the way through. A plastic head band is not the best possibility on such a premium headphone.JBL also has listed Smart Technology: Personalize your listening experience via the MY JBL Headphones app on the box. This app is not compatible with MANY devices and judging by the many bad app reviews it doesnt even function or work correctly. Again if a company is going to push such a high dollar product they need to get everything corrected ASAP.JBL Everest Elite 700So overall from my standing point as a professional DJ the JBL Everest Elite 700 is a massively overpriced full plastic headphone with okay sound and features.",StephenCraig,1
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Good Sound,I've tried a few other headphones and the one thing I like about these is the range in which you can leave the area and still receive a signal for sound. Others went away within 10 ft.,LongIslandSound,4

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Great Sound. Good Customer Service..You'll Need It,"I really like these JBL Everest Elite. Their outer quality is soft and comfortable on my ears and on my head. The controls are intuitive. And the sound quality is incredible for a Bluetooth headphone. The noise cancelation doesn't cancel entirely everything out, but if you're listening to music it might as well have. I do like the two levels of Ambient Aware and I like that I can use these wired if the charge dies. My only problem is that you need to hang on to the packaging as you'll inevitably be sending them in for warranty work. The charge port went bad after 6 months and the headphones wouldn't charge or power on. The same thing happened to my husband's set. They are protected for a year by JBL and the customer service experience is easy to go through. The turn around on my new set was nominal. Other than Bose wired NC, these are the only other Noise Canceling phones in their class worth the price point. And they're bluetooth without sacrifice. Despite the issue they have with the USB port going bad, I would still choose these again over the competition. I am purchasing another pair for a gift.",LivingDedGrrl,4

Not painful, so to speak, but the pressure of the ear cups is definitely uncomfortable after about 15 minutes.",Obamasfriendorsomething,3

I was not impressed with the sound. I took them back and after doing lots of listen tests, chose the Evers Elite 700. Great sound, great app, good battery life. Great controls as well. I liked the sound of the Boss Quiet Comfort 35 just a little bit more, but didn't think the difference was worth the price. I'd recommend these headphones to anyone.

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Fantastic Sound, Shoddy Electronics. Keep Receipt.","I have 2 pairs of these. They are very comfortable, and for a bluetooth headphone, they sound is incredible. There's just one problem....I have to replace them every 3 months. They have that JBL sound we love, but the electronics are shoddy and JBL doesn't seem to want to fix this. All 3 units have been sent back for just failing out of the blue. They just magically stop turning on and won't charge or anything....and this is usually after 2-6 months. I am a casual user, so they're still brand new when they die. JBL will only honor the warranty for 1 year after the purchase price, even though my second unit is being replaced a second time in 3 months for the same manufacturer defect. So, you'll spend a couple hundred plus tax on a pair of headphones that won't even be burned in when they die, and then you're just expected to purchase another set for the same price that will do the same thing. I keep them in their case. They never get wet or thrown around or abused. They're expensive and I treat them as such....but they still just...stop....working out of the blue. JBL is aware of this issue but doesn't seem to fix it. Keep the receipt and buy the Best Buy plan if you buy these. You'll need both.",LivingDedGrrl,2

These qualities are important to me because I'm a musician and music arranger. With products like this, I'm able to do my job more effectively. Having the Bluetooth feature is a huge plus so I'm not limited in one space. The noise cancellation/ ambient sound feature is nice too. It'll allow you to either ignore or be aware of your surroundings. I strongly recommend JBL, infinity, and Harmon Kardon products for your music listening experience!",Herb,5

Ive tried the best (Bose 350 dollars for like match to JBL) and the worst to find the JBL outstanding for 240+ dollars. ( bought these on sale ) The JBL headphones are comfortable, but not as light as the Bose, but still, they don't weigh down your ears or top of head after 2+ hours of use. These are well built, and are flexible for the many different sizes of heads out there. Mine is tiny, so these can look a little goofy on me, but for the average head, they will look just fine! The reason you would buy these though, would be for the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its price point versus Bose. At 240 dollars, these are awesome. At 300 dollars (normal price) I would say its up to the individual if they want to save for the higher priced competition. The ANC is good, but not perfect, and compared to Bose, do not cancel out all of the noise. But what I like about these are the ability to bring 2 different levels of outside noise into the headphones which is nice when your walking around the airports all day and want to avoid collisions. And while the ANC is not the best, at 240+ dollars, you really cant go wrong. The best about these? They can be updated VIA the app! Meaning that JBL can fix or update anything related to the headphones without having to physically upgrade over time. While I'm not alone on my opinion related to the ANC, (seems most tech reviews state the same thing,) I would still recommend these at the price point I paid!",TravelsFrequently,4

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Very Nice and Great Sound,"I was looking for nice over the ear wireless headphones. I read tons of reviews and everything was leading me to the Bose QC35. After listening to them in the store, I was impressed with the richness of the sound, but didn't really want noise cancelling (I've got a pair of Bose in ear for that purpose and those are simply the best at blocking out unwanted sound...much better than the QC models IMHO). They didn't block out a lot of noise in the store and the noise cancelling seemed a bit overbearing. I started trying different models in the store and literally stumbled upon the JBLs. It didn't take long for me to be totally impressed with the sound quality and full richness of the sound. I was going to the the non-ANC model, but they were out of stock. This one was close in price so I splurged a bit. I'm glad I did. ANC - it's really not that useful. I does block out some ambient sound while music is playing and gives a bit more focus to the music really. Does it drown out voices or other louder noises? No. This is very minimal effect. The nice thing is that the music sounds precisely the same with it on or off. The ANC can easily be switched off while preserving the sound quality. If anything I'd say the ANC might clean up the music a bit, but it's not so processed that it changes the sound. For louder volumes, you'd be hard-pressed to tell if it's on or off. If you're looking for serious noise cancellation, this is not the one to get. The packaging is very nice and top notch. As a surprise, there is a carrying case included. Just a pouch and not hard sided, but a nice pouch that is not at all cheap looking or feeling. Kudos for that. The sound - it's great! Really great! Full and rich and not at all processed sounding. It's really nice. Deep bass, clear highs. Really can't tell that this is not plugged in as the sound is superb. Even at full volume, there is never any punch to the base, just a nice low rumble. The highs never screech, but get delivered with nice clarity. The mids and voices are clear and right where they should be. JBL did this right. The app on the phone has preset equalizer settings, or you can create your own custom profile (more than one). The bluetooth has great range and doesn't skip a beat. The battery percentage shows up near the bluetooth icon on my iPhone. It paired quickly and without any issues. I just got these a few hours ago so can't really comment on the battery life just yet. Plugged in with the included cable, the sound is exactly the same so far as I can tell. That is - as long as they are switched 'on'. When switched off, they will work, but there is a drop in quality. When a cable is plugged in, bluetooth is shut off immediately. When the cable gets unplugged, bluetooth switches back on right away and it re-connects with the phone. The size/weight is a lot. These are not small and can be a bit heavy resting on the top of your head. The padding is there but could be more to alleviate some pressure. Could just be me as I've not had over the ear headphones in a long time, but worth mentioning here. Another really nice thing is that with the app, I could update the firmware over bluetooth. I think previous models were windows pc only, but this updated easily and without a problem. Some have said that the lag when watching videos is terrible. Must have been a firmware thing because there is positively no lag at all. After just a short amount of time I'm quite impressed and happy with my purchase. Not so sure about the white color, but for some strange reason is a lot less in price over the black ones so I saved the money. At BestBuy they have a display where you can plug in your phone and listen to your own music or a pre-set playlist on the display. I HIGHLY recommend doing that and comparing the same songs or videos with multiple models. Forget these reviews as sound is highly subjective. Just don't pass these up as they really are a very nice yet may be overlooked for Beast or Bose.",CCCCCC,5

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Awesome Headphones,"The JBL Everest Elite 700's are the best of 3 wireless headphones. They are also the the most expensive of the three. My other pairs are the Bose wireless and the Klipsch wireless. All 3 are comfortable. The JBL and Bose are over the ear and the Klipsch is on the ear. The JBL is the best at noise canceling. Also the App for controlling ambient noise levels and the equalizer is pretty cool. It also let's you know how much battery you have left.The JBL does need to be adjusted from time to time for comfort, but that's not a big deal. The battery last the day and charges up pretty quickly. Just be sure you actually turn them off before putting them in the case or you will be disappointed when trying to use them. They are supposed to have an auto off feature, but I did find my headphones at 10% after a full charge and in the case for 2 days. Maybe the battery doesn't hold a charge for very long. I figured it was in the box at the store for longer than that and was fine out of the box when I tried them that first time before their first full charge. Guess I'll have to experiment a bit more.While the headphones are AWESOME , the case is lacking. For the price of the headphones you would think that you could get a hardshell case. The case should have pockets that can store the audio and charging cables securely. Also the provided case is difficult to carry with NO strap or handle. It is possible to inadvertently turn on the headphones while carrying them.",Goose,5

JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),All Representatives Are Busy [BLAH BLAH BLAH],"All Representatives Are Busy [BLAH BLAH BLAH]Let me save you a down-the-rabbit-hole support call ;-)If you have the newest AppleTV and are looking for a wireless listening experience, the JBL Everest Elite 700 isn’t going to help you with that, not even if you’re willing to pay a surcharge on top of the premium $300 price-tag.It doesn’t pair with the ATV4, and 60 minutes of music-on-hold when calling the JBL tech-support line isn’t going to change that :-(When I finally did reach JBL tech support, the rep placed me yet again on hold for another 15 minutes while he checked. Upon his glorious return, he said they’d received other calls and further knowledge on compatibility with the AppleTV was pending. I asked what that meant exactly, the response was “the engineers were ‘in a hurry’ to launch the headphones and might have made mistakes by using a non-standard version of Bluetooth”. As I purchased these during a short $100-off BestBuy holiday flash-sale, I asked if this would at some point be corrected with a firmware update — the answer was “you can try and if it works, then yes”. Hmmm… I started to look for hidden cameras, wondering what prank show I was on ;-)I’m sure these sound great if your device is compatible with whatever ‘non-standard’ version of Bluetooth these headphones have inside. I actually purchased them exclusively to use with my AppleTV :-(",benjitek,1
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Stellar All-Rounder,"Following in the prestigious heritage of the Everest line from JBL, the Elite 700 sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones. Though not a new type of product, in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well-rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios.The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents. The Elite 700’s is nicely presented in a cut out. Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located. This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection, as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage. Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps. Beneath the box is the one button standard 3.5 to 2.5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies. Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and/or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware. Lastly, we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation.The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly. Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate; however, the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use.On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3.5mm input jack, the micro USB charge and sync port, as well as the built-in microphone. Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button, which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom. Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button, the play/pause, answer/hang-up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button.The Elite 700 has a companion app, which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store. Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive. You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you. It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low, medium or high or off. You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own. Moving back, you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger. Lastly, you can activate TruNote, which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum, and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it. The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be. I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured “hey, I have a 30-day return window, what’s there to lose?” Well, these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential. The wireless mode alone is simply excellent. The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution, but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven. The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25, but not quite there. With ANC off, these sound great. Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance, I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response, but in stock, they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm, very slight. I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off, the bass is tight, quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass. It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V-MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease, but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless. The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open, clean, articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone. No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity, none. Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick, it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers & Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2. For a wireless headphone, this is honestly quite amazing. When the Elite 700 is wired, they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity. From the stellar 15-23 hour battery life, to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list.",Danny,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Good, but not great","In theory, these are a really great set of over-the-ear headphones. They combine wireless BT connectivity with the option for wired, active noise cancellation with ‘Ambient Aware' (let's you let in a certain amount of outside sound), a cool sounding built in 'calibration' technology, and it's all made by a well-respected brand name in audio. In execution, it doesn't quite live up to what I would have expected for $300+ There are better (and less expensive) options out there. They don't sound bad and the build quality is great. But I'm of the opinion that they aren't worth the price.First, the good. They're easy to set up and pair with your device They are solidly constructed. They are fairly comfortable (initially) for how heavy they are, and the ear cups are contoured nicely for a better fit around your ear. Out of the box they sound acceptable, and once you download the app and tweak the EQ, it starts sounding much better (especially once you turn off the noise cancellation).But there are so many little annoyances.These are not something that I'd ever choose to bring out in public. For being a wireless mobile device, they're really bulky. They don't start off uncomfortable at all, but they get there after about 30-45 minutes of use. You will notice the heat and, if you have a sensitive head, crown pressure.JBL Harman touts a technology called TruNote that supposedly analyzes the position of the drivers in relation to your ears, making the sound better due to ‘personalization’. This is run through the app. You put the headphones on, run TruNote (which plays one quick tone similar to an Audessey auto-EQ setup on a Denon receiver), takes a few seconds to ‘calibrate’, and then moves on. I can’t say that I noticed a dramatic difference between when I ran it and when I didn’t.Speaking of the aforementioned app, you have to download it in order to optimize your listening experience. It allows you to do several things, including running TruNote, turning noise cancelation on/off, and tweaking the Ambient Aware & EQ settings. The one that will likely get the most usage is turning the noise cancelation off and tweaking the EQ.Note I said ‘turn noise cancelation off. The sound quality improves fairly dramatically with it off. In my opinion, it’s average execution of noise cancelation, so it’s worth it to have off. The ear cups provide ample noise isolation as it is, but if you’re going to pay for noise cancelation, you should be able to use it without affecting the sound negatively.The EQ is where you’ll get the most dramatic performance increase, as it allows you to adjust 3 bands each (total of 9 bands) within the low, medium, and high frequency sound spectrum. In fact, I would say this is absolutely essential in order to get the most out of the headphones. As mentioned earlier, they sound acceptable out of the box but lack some kick out of the bass and the mids start to get tinny when increasing the volume. There are 3 presets and then you can customize and save different personal settings. I like all of this in theory. Different EQ settings for different types of music is great, but objectively, a common listener may not want to mess with this…especially since you have to open the app every time to do this. And to be clear, you don’t HAVE to open the app to get the headphones to work; but you have to open the app to take advantage of the noise cancelation, the EQ, etc.It’s great that you can use the headphones wired when they run out of power. This also increases the sound quality. But what happens when you want to use them wired AND still have power AND want to use the app (to have access to the EQ)? That does not seem possible. Once you go wired it defaults to shutting off the bluetooth connection. And if you reconnect it defaults to sending sound wirelessly.When you’re not listening to music you can use the headphones for phone calls. Call quality is average.Finally, it’s worth mentioning a couple sets of controls on the back of the left and right cups. On the left there are volume controls + play/pause. On the right there is the Bluetooth power/connect button and a ‘smart’ button that is assignable (via the app) to either adjusting the level of Ambient Aware (low, medium, high) or noise cancelation on/off. These are great and convenient additions, but you have to keep in mind that when you need to adjust the headphones on your head (and you will…see the previously mentioned ‘uncomfortable after extended use’ comment), you’ll likely hit these buttons. It’s not a big deal, but it requires some behavior change.All of these small annoyances led me to a return.I understand that these are supposed to be more ‘professional’ / higher-end headphones for people who also want a wire-free experience and mobility. But somewhat complicated, unintuitive, and unnecessary features should not outweigh the primary goal, which is mobility. The bulky design and weight would immediately disqualify them. And the fact that you have to do some work to get them sounding right takes them even further out. If you're an audiophile, your primary use is at home, and you just want a pair of wireless headphones (because as an audiophile you are likely using wired connections all the time), these would probably work (though I think there are better options). These are not a great option for a common listener, as you likely want to just throw the on, connect, and go.",bulletproofcharm,3
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"comfortable fit, good sound",I tried many head phones before deciding on the over the ear JBL Everest Elite 700 wireless headphones. The sound quality and noise cancelling is as good as any of the other brands I’ve tried in this price range. Even without using the noise cancelling the over the ear cups provide good sound insulation. To top it off they are comfortable headphones.,CollegeParent,4
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Excellent sound and very comfortable,I am so glad that I purchased this for my fiancé. I did a ton of research on different headphones and I am glad I spent the extra money on the noise cancellation. Super clear sound and they are not as heavy as they look so it's comfortable on your ears.,Carrie,5
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),Based on the use from a professional DJ,"Please do remember that this review is based on the use from a professional DJ and not your normal “Audiophile”. Now with that statement out of the way I was not very impressed with my overall purchase of the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 Headphones. There are some features that I did enjoy having, but there was a lot more that I was not very happy about.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700We’ll start out with the positives about the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 headphones. The headphones them selves fit very snug on my head, but that also might very from person to person. Very comfortable to wear during a 4 to 6 hour event. They turned out to be lightweight even though they are a larger size of headphone. I really enjoyed the perfectly sculpted ear cushions. They cup the ears perfectly and block out most of the ambient sound.The JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 features Bluetooth 4.1 and connects with ease every single time. The Bluetooth allows you to use the headphone built-in media controls on the edge of the left ear piece. JBL® has also allowed use of the built-in microphones for hands free calling when paired with a mobile device like a BlackBerry, Droid, or iPhone. Now if you don’t want to use or can’t use the Bluetooth feature they do come with a 3.5mm jack cable.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 is also powered by a built in rechargeable battery that will last 15 amazing hours, so there are no worries about running out of power mid set. They charge up with the use of a micro USB port on the bottom of the right ear cup. The JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 has built in auto off sensors to preserve that amazing 15 hour battery as well.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700Now onward to the nitty-gritty. JBL® has packed them with NXTGen Active Noise Cancelling. It’s a cool feature and concept, but as for DJ use it’s not needed and if you get the basic JBL® Everest™ 700 it can save you $100 USD. When spinning with this feature on I did notice the headset speakers bottoming out. This made it very annoying when trying to pick out specific sounds during a mix.I feel like the structure of the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 could have been a lot better. Spending $300 USD on headphones they need to feel like they will last and not snap apart when you take them on and off. JBL® might have done this to gain the lightweight feel or just to save money on construction. If I used these for one tourist season outside everyday I don’t for see them making it all the way through. A plastic head band is not the best possibility on such a premium headphone.JBL® also has listed “Smart Technology: Personalize your listening experience via the MY JBL Headphones app” on the box. This app is not compatible with MANY devices and judging by the many bad app reviews it doesn’t even function or work correctly. Again if a company is going to push such a high dollar product they need to get everything corrected ASAP.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700So overall from my standing point as a professional DJ the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 is a massively overpriced full plastic headphone with okay sound and features.",StephenCraig,1
JBL,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),"Great headphones, but ANC needs more work","As I travel almost weekly for work, I have plenty of opportunity to wear these out, and I can say that so far (3 months in) they are working out well. My 3rd purchase of 200+ dollar headphones, I wanted to try out the 3 major brands in competition, and these are so far the best sub 300 dollar headphones you can buy with ANC. Ive tried the best (Bose 350 dollars for like match to JBL) and the worst to find the JBL outstanding for 240+ dollars. ( bought these on sale )  The JBL headphones are comfortable, but not as light as the Bose, but still, they don't weigh down your ears or top of head after 2+ hours of use. These are well built, and are flexible for the many different sizes of heads out there. Mine is tiny, so these can look a little goofy on me, but for the average head, they will look just fine! The reason you would buy these though, would be for the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its price point versus Bose. At 240 dollars, these are awesome. At 300 dollars (normal price) I would say its up to the individual if they want to save for the higher priced competition. The ANC is good, but not perfect, and compared to Bose, do not cancel out all of the noise. But what I like about these are the ability to bring 2 different levels of outside noise into the headphones which is nice when your walking around the airports all day and want to avoid collisions. And while the ANC is not the best, at 240+ dollars, you really cant go wrong. The best about these? They can be updated VIA the app! Meaning that JBL can fix or update anything related to the headphones without having to physically upgrade over time. While I'm not alone on my opinion related to the ANC, (seems most tech reviews state the same thing,) I would still recommend these at the price point I paid!",TravelsFrequently,4

Netgear,Nighthawk AC1900 Dual-Band Wi-Fi USB Adapter,Good nic card,"I bought the Nighthawk WiFi Adapter in order to back my office computers direct cable connection, which sometimes has connection issues. This WiFi adapter works pretty well considering that the modem is located downstairs and in another part of the house. My direct (hard wired) connection usually yields around 300-350 mps, while the Nighthawk WiFi adapter is yielding around 200 mps, which is not that bad. This particular adapter should work well for all of the computers in my house because I have a relatively fast internet connection speed to start with. However, for those who are connecting at around 50 mps, I think you'd need to be relatively close to the modem for it to work properly.",Renwop,4

Very happy with the Nighthawk adapter. A word of warning though - it states it has a very strong magnetic base so I would not recommend placing it to close to the computer.

Samsung,Samsung Universal 3100mAh Portable External Battery Charger - White,Probably Not The Best Option,"A friend of mine has a portable battery pack, which I have used, & it seems to charge a lot faster & supposedly longer. He claims to get 8 phone charges when his pack is fully charged. This Samsung battery pack is 3100mAh & his was 3300mAh. Either way, it doesn't appear to hold a charge very long, nowhere near 8 charges, & not a universal charge port. My wife & i have Androids so it works fine but not compatible with Iphone or the ability to hook up a USB connection out. If it kept its charge longer, I would give 5 stars because it's small & charging cord is built into it, so no extra cable required.",JP67,2

Samsung,Samsung Universal 3100mAh Portable External Battery Charger - White,Have to One Star This One,"Unlike all the good reviews I read before purchasing this, my experience has been quite the opposite & I am very, very disappointed. I think it took about 3 or 4 hours to fully charge the battery pack when I first got it, & it would then charge my Galaxy 4 phone in about 2 hours or so, but then the battery pack is done. After charging my phone fully, the battery pack drains quite fast when not in use. I started to recharge my phone tonight & although it charged at first, I noticed my phone suddenly began losing the charge. I figured that the battery pack had drained while in the drawer, so I plugged it in to charge it, & after 1 hour, the battery pack still had a red light on, felt quite hot, & the charger at the point where it is plugged into the wall, was so hot it alarmed me, something that had never happened when charging my phone. I immediately removed it, with the red light on the battery pack still on, & decided to see if I could see just where things stood. I plugged my phone into it & saw a temporary green light. Then nothing. My phone is charging slowly but who knows what will happen next. Some are saying they've gone on day long adventures, away from local plug in availability, & had no problem losing power to their devices. I'm in my own home & can only get 1 charge on 1 occasion, & a burning hot charger on another occasion. This device is absolutely serving no purpose whatsoever, as I can charge my phone on the charger that it came with. If this thing won't hold it's own charge, unused, for more than a couple hours, what's the point? Totally useless in an emergency. What a waste of money. And it's too late to return it. So I'm stuck with a piece of junk & am out $43. It was on sale for $40....now the sale price is down to $30. Piece of junk.....maybe just a lemon, but this is very discouraging & I have to say don't bother. Also, be sure to test repeatedly, on different levels of service, from the very beginning so you can return if it isn't going to last. I've got my eye on another one, more expensive but hopefully better quality. Just waiting for it to go on sale. Next time, I'm not going to go with blind trust....I'll test it every which was but loose starting immediately, & return it if it doesn't live up. This product is a dud.",kindajazzy,1

This one I just put on back of phone while I talk and it is just the same as holding the phone to talk. No one is even aware it's there. So It is the best I have found.Pros are its flat and lays behind phone while I talk. Charges my large (phablet) phone fast and completely.

Samsung,Samsung Universal 3100mAh Portable External Battery Charger - White,"It's thin, easy to carry and has a hide away USB.","What I like most about this charger is the stow away USB and how thin and easy it is to carry around while using my Galaxy Note 3. Plug in the USB and back the charger flush with phone to make this convenient plus easy to hold onto, even with such a huge device as the GN3. (I admire its look as a matching accessory for the GN3 but $60 for 3100mAH seems pricey. I've spotted this same unit selling for more than $20 less on the internet though it seems doubtful you'd have the same support from third parties as with Best Buy). This charger is/was offered in two colors (black or white) with the same finish and faux stitching as the GN3, if you prefer that look, and comes with a small, easy to store charging cable for the device. This charger has a percentage level indicator that's not precise, though still useful...simply locate the 'button' on that side of charger and press it in. These are the levels per lights: Blue light = 100-80% battery life; Green light = 80-20% battery life; Red light = 20-5% battery life; Red blinking light = 5-0% battery life.",Aviation4,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Terrible design!,"Cannot hit play, FF or Rev, etc, without having your hand/arm over the touch pad which is VERY sensitive! The slightest brush can mess up what you are watching. I have to brace my forearm on the bottom part, keep my wrist bent up very high in order to use the playing options. Even then it's not a given it won't sense your arm over the top and change it to a different channel or activity. Also no way to use a number pad that I can find so have to grab another remote to do that. It's a nice idea but very flawed design.

One Remote to Rule Them All!,"When I was a kid (I'm 45 now) it seemed like we always had 3 - 8 remotes sitting on the coffee at any given time while growing up. Trying to figure out how to watch a movie on the VCR could be a real challenge sometimes. Then Logitech/Harmony started making these remotes that controlled everything and they have only gotten better with time. I liked this one so much that I bought two of them - one for the family room and one for my man cave in the garage. I really like how easy it is now to hook these remotes up to a computer, program them exactly the way I want with favorites and different devices etc. The first time I did it, it took about an hour. However, I created a profile on their website and the second time I did it, it was only a matter of minutes because it had saved all my information from the first time and I had more experience doing it, too.One Note: Before you start, get a pad of paper and a pencil/pen and write down ALL the makes and model numbers of all the devices you want this thing to control.

Firstly you cannot control your Amazon FireTV and other devices with it unless you shell out more money and buy the hub (which I did and will be leaving the same feedback for that also). The original Harmony One is able to control the FireTV, fast forward a few years and now all of a sudden this new remote has lost the ability to unless you buy the Hub. Let me clarify, You CAN control the Amazon FireTV after you get it set up (with the hub), but switch to another device (AppleTV, ShieldTV, Playstation etc) then go back to the FireTV, the bluetooth disconnects and you have to go through a grueling process to reconnect it all again by resetting the Hub, deleting your device, re-adding your device.

There are no numbers to change channels and its impossible to find them on the touchscreen. When you want to pause a program, or rewind it, the controls are out of reach of your thumb and then the unit is un-balanced in the hand. You end up having to use both hands.

The setup software is relatively simple and straightforward.I find the button layout actually preferable to my 880. I didn't like how all the control buttons were so low on the 880 and like having them higher up on the Ultimate One. I also find the touch screen quick and reponsive, and I LOVE how it is editable directly on the remote. With the 880 I would have had to connected it back to a PC to do a simple button edit. With this, I can edit directly on the device and quickly customize the locations of each button.I will say the main negative I have found is lacking control for Roku and Amazon fire, though the 880 had that same issue.

After about an hour of setting and tweaking, they work flawlessly.The remote is set up to turn on a player, turn on and switch inputs of both the receiver and TV with the push of one button set up in the touch screen. You need to make sure you have your remotes as the Harmony One sets up to the most popular frequency and The Harmony One is a learning remote, so while plugged in to your PC, follow instructions by pointing your remote to the Harmony One and it will learn the IR frequency of that remote.",ByRobert L.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Don't worry. I was happy.,"My first Harmony remote did not survive a drop on the floor. The second one died when the cat knocked it on the floor. I was dismayed when I learned that the old model was no longer available and at the price of the new one. I was also a bit taken aback by the negative comments of some reviewers regarding the Harmony Ultimate One. I am pleased to report that after using the new model for a few weeks, my fears were groundless. My old system setup transferred to the new device using the online programming with only a moderate amount of confusion and hair pulling. I find the new display empowering. Several of the buttons are not in what I would consider the optimal locations but I don't find that to be a major problem. Overall, I'm very happy with this unit.There was also some confusion on my part about some kind of ultimate hub device. It does NOT come with the Ultimate One package that I purchased nor was it needed to control my devices. I'm still not clear on what it is, but that doesn't matter as I don't need it.Oh yes, this time we built a little wooden box with an open top in which to house the controller and its charger base (and also a portable telephone and charger base). The cat will have a hard time damaging THIS controller! On the down side, I recently bought a cordless mouse and this morning I had to hunt to find where the cat left it. But that's another story.",ByValerie,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Excellent remote. Highly recommend!,"I upgraded from a Harmony 650, which my family found to be too confusing (I was constantly hearing The TV is broken again!).The Ultimate One simplifies just about everything. Setup for 5 devices (Samsung TV, Vizio Soundbar, Magnavox DVD, Roku Sony VCR) was a breeze. The software automatically copied settings from the 650, and adding TV channels via location lookup was very cool.Once it was setup, which took no more than 10 minutes, it worked amazingly well. The turn-on procedures for activities go much quicker than the 650, and the signal actually seems to get to the devices now, where as it was hit-or-miss with the 650 -- the primary reason for the TV being broken. :)Touch screen is quite responsive. Not as responsive as a smartphone, but close.Upgraded to the latest firmware. Some things about it are nice, such as information about what it's actually doing during a startup sequence. However, I'm not a fan of the new look of the menus. All caps for the text is annoying. Wish there was a way to change font size/style.Negative reviews regarding button layout are somewhat valid, but not worth removing a star. I found that its easy to get used to where they are in a short time of use. Most usual functions can be done with the buttons while watching TV or video (and there are 4 programmable generic buttons on the bottom as well), so it is rare that you would need to look down to hunt for something on the screen.I am impressed, and I think my family will be much happier with the simplified layout and better automation.",ByDmdStar,5

You drag and drop actions into a sequence for each of your desired functions like Watch TV* It has long battery life and is rechargable* It wakes up when it detects it's been picked upDislike:* Programming interface forces you to start with a base set of commands for some actions and you cannot add pauses between them. My devices need pauses so I had to do some wonky workarounds to get the devices sequences to work as required.* It assumes you are always starting from a specific state: e.g. all devices are powered off. If one of your devices is on, then when it sends the power signal the device turns off instead of on, and then you are in a funky state and you have to send your devices a command to power everything off, manually toggle that one device and then start all over again.* DON'T change the settings of a device without using the Harmony remote or again you will get into a wonky state and it gets confused, because it only knows the last state it told each device to be in.* I know how to work around these idiosyncrasies, but it confuses anyone else trying to use it and frustrates the daylights out of my wife.",ByScott Redfern,3

It's a dead skill. Deal with it (Speaking mainly of the guy that marched up and down the QA section telling people to stay away at all costs). It's the same as those old computer programmers in the the early/mid 90's that kept hating on Windows because DOS was better...yeah, keep telling yourself that.This thing works just fine. It's highly customizable. I was even able to put my family photo as the background and load Xbox, bluray, directv icons, etc...for my various activities. Have your manufacturer part numbers ready, go to the site or download the app, create and activity, and plug in the part numbers for each activity...good to go. They have an easy peasy setup wizard that guides you through the process. I have had ZERO issues with this remote. the ergonomics, contrary to a lot of reviews, are fantastic. It's a two-position ergonomic setup. Hold low to access the d-pad, volume, channel, guide, dvr, and touch-screen, and hold high (palm over the touch screen) to access the actionable buttons (play, pause, rewind, etc...). Underside ergonomics allow for grip with a trigger-like extension and a large bulge at the backend (which is the battery housing).",ByJay,5

The download of software refused to communicate with the device, the ability to transfer functions from one device that was set up correctly was impossible due to software issues and over the last two days I have returned TWO devices that both were defective. Look, I liked the intuitive way that the remote worked and was trying to find a remote that my wife could operate without a degree in computer language and serious complexity issues.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Excellent remote that could use a couple of design tweaks...,"BLUF: Great remote and would buy againThis is a replacement for a Harmony 700 (discontinued) that was beginning to fail and this was a great upgrade.For background, I have been using and programming various remotes for years going back to older Philips Pronto remotes- This is a very intuitive and powerful platform in a reasonably priced package! Coming from another Harmony remote, the initial setup was very simple with a few tweaks for preference and new capability. I say that acknowledging I am something of a geek and understand the basics of how remotes work and their limitations. Even for the technologically challenged, Logitech has done a good job of making the programming interface intuitive and easy to use but still powerful enough for advanced users to customize. If anything, it errors on the side of simplicity vice functionality.Some of the biggest concerns I had was the fast-forward/skip button since the two functions have been combined into a single button with this remote. I was quite leery of this as a DirecTV customer but happy to report that with a bit of tweaking and use of the gestures this is completely a non-issue. Only shortfall I can complain about is the lack of immediate access to the number pad- you can swipe left/right to it but I would prefer to map a soft key to bring it up. Niggling issue that may be possible but I haven't found an easy way to do it just yet.The biggest complaint and the area where Logitech misses the mark is (as others have pointed out) with the basic ergonomics. The hard buttons are great, the touch screen is great and the overall size of the remote is great, they just need to re-organize! Put the touchscreen at the very top and move the transport controls (FF, pause, record, play etc.) under the screen! It would even benefit from being slightly longer to allow the main controls to sit just above center (where your thumb naturally sits) and fit better in the hand. I complain about this, pointing out this is a great unit that could benefit from a refresh- same functionality in a slightly different package.To wrap this up, I am VERY pleased with this remote overall. It is not perfect and could use a change to the basic layout BUT it is a SOLID unit that is very flexible and a pleasure to use. If you are considering this a a first universal remote or an upgrade to an existing one, it is well worth it.",ByAllenB,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Functional Remote with More than a Few Frustrating Features,"This remote replaced my venerable Harmony One, which I loved dearly. The Ultimate One's dock does not have a light, which I miss when returning the remote for charging in the dark. The remote has a lot of annoying features. The most noticeable is the lock screen, but that can be disabled. The location of the play, fast forward, and rewind buttons do not fall within the natural arc of your thumb like they did with the Harmony One. The Volume and Channel buttons are only illuminated in the middle, not on the ends where the up and down buttons are actually located...this makes it more difficult to press them in the dark. With the previous remote, my projector would never turn off automatically, even though I programmed separate 'off' and 'on' codes. I simply copied the programming from the old remote to the new using the web site, and in less than 10 minutes, the new remote was operational, and the projector problem was gone! I have love-hate relationship with this remote. Logitech should move the play/forward/back/stop buttons back below the screen where they're more readily accessed by one's thumbs, and illuminate both the up and down buttons, and you'd have a winner. I've gotten used to the remote, but given its frustrations, I consider it over-priced. But the Logitech Harmony software and approach still make it easier to use than separate component remotes.

Just when you sit down to watch your favorite show, the remote stops working you have to sync the remote or install yet another firmware update. Sometimes this requires you to connect the remote to your computer which must be in the same room as the hub. This takes several minutes. After the updates, you will have to go through rearrange all your screens the way you had them before which is a pain in the butt when all you wanted to do was sit down to relax watch some TV.After only 18 months, our remote would only show the Harmony logo would not go any further.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Ultimate One: Inexcusably Buggy Software,"Compared to all of the other Logitech Products I have owned, including numerous mice, keyboards, and three Harmony Ones, the Ultimate One performs surprisingly poorly with regard to its programming software.Maybe once I get it working it will work OK, but that will never excuse the following: 1) Would not work on a Win 7 64 bit Home Premium computer, failed with multiple download errors (Unexpected or Unknown error/ try again) downloading the Harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app 2) Would not work on a Win 7 32 bit Ultimate computer, failed with the same multiple download errors downloading the Harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app 3) Finally installed on a Win 8.1 computer, retrieved my info from previous Harmony One (or did I, can't confirm this, none of the supposedly retrieved settings are ones I have used in several years) yet failed to retrieve settings for watching TV or Bluray, e.g, my DirecTV One or DirecTV Two receivers (e.g., Watch TV) or Bluray activities (Sony Bluray) (which of course are the primary activities for which I purchased remote).For 250 after 2 hours with basically no progress to me that is worse than useless, I have wasted precious family time without any satisfaction for which I purchased remote, I seek products that work as advertised without unsolvable complications (e.g., unexpected error, unknown error, no tech support available, no Google threads regarding error messages, implicit solution: buy/try another computer). If I were a teenager this conundrum might be interesting, but as it is, I do not have lots of spare time to tinker with problems caused by engineers who release products that are not ready for prime time. Oh and by the way Logitech keeps more or less banker's hours, i.e., Monday through Friday 8 to 5 so forget about tech support unless you don't have a job.By way of comparison, it used to take me 20 minutes to program the Harmony One, with the Ultimate One and 2 hours into the project, all I can control is the volume on the AV amplifier.Wish I had never had reason to make an acquaintance with Ultimate One, unless you have lots of time to kill I recommend that you avoid it and wait for next iteration of Harmony remote, or seek alternative company's remote if available.As piece of hardware, the Ultimate One may have promise. If I get out of the woods with the software, I will post the results.Addendum: 04/19/14: OK, now that the remote is programmed, I love this remote! Overall I prefer Logitech products (e.g., Razer mouse, K400 illuminated wireless keyboard, Squeezebox Touch, Harmony One), no design is perfect given that compromises are always necessary, but I tend to prefer their solutions, so I have high expectations. As for the Harmony Ultimate, I like the form factor including the decreased size from the One (perhaps the DVR buttons should be on the bottom but it does not bother me as it does others) and the flexibility and power of the programming is a definite leap forward. I haven't yet tried the onscreen leap forward/jump back buttons, but if I don't like them, I can always program two of the colored buttons at the bottom to perform those functions. For me it was not that hard to program, I just needed to take a break after all the initial frustration when the software would not install.If it were not for the install glitches I would give the Ultimate One a 5 out of 5 stars. As my experience got off to such a rocky start and others may not own computers with a variety of Operating Systems in order to troubleshoot MyHarmony software install issues (and lack of evening/weekend technical support) 4 stars is is as high as I can go.I believe seamless compatibility with Win7 should be a given, although I suppose you could try and blame Windows, but for a company as widespread as Logitech it seems they should be able to do a lot better. FWIW the Win8.1 computer is not my favorite, but I purchased it a year after Win 8 was released in order to attempt to keep up with the times, and this is the second occasion it has come in handy i.e., when my daughter had to do violin tests for public middle school orchestra, the Smart Music app failed with an incomprehensible error, same problem with only daytime M-F tech support, and no searchable threads to explore any solutions. So we installed SmartMusic on the new all in one portable Win 8.1 Dell and never looked back, problem solved.10/12/14 Still mostly love this remote, my vote remains 4 1/2 stars.In case it hasn't already been answered via other threads, the DirecTV jump forward/back button functions (approx 30 sec forward, 7 seconds back, if memory serves) do still exist on this remote but they are indeed hidden by an Android-style tap versus press/hold gesture, i.e., tapping the FF or RW button brings up the fast forward/rewind functions, e.g., 1-4 taps equals 1-4 times speed for FF/RW, whereas press/hold brings up the jump forward/back functions (with a vibrate signal to indicate success in accessing the press/hold feature, so you know when to let go, found these functions by accident one day when I pressed and held the buttons a bit too long, one second I suppose).My only real gripe with this remote now is that occasionally I press the power off button when I am trying to press the rewind button it would be nice if the power button was a bit more physically isolated from the RW button if you don't watch TV every day sometimes your tactile grasp of where the buttons are on the remote is less secure, and you really don't need to power off without having to look at the remote.Bottom line and in contradiction of other reviews regarding the tactile layout of the remote: it is still excellent without need for visual guidance once you learn the layout and compares well to that of the Harmony One (really, who needs physical number buttons when you're watching DVR) and easy to operate, even if you are working out on an elliptical machine while watching TV, I might add.",ByAmazon Customer,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,The luxury end of remotes,"After having a room full of remotes, I was excited to set up and try the Harmony Remote. The instructions were simple to follow. The screen is clear and easy to read. It does take a bit of time to get used to, in relation to turning the systems on and off and where to go within the screen. I really like the fact you can integrate multiple systems, especially in an era where we have so many systems in one area (games, cable, dvd, tv etc.) The one downfall for me is that it's another cable with another charger. I already have a computer, bluetooth and phone charging and now I have to keep the charging station out for the remote. This may not be a big tradeoff for some, but I found it a bit annoying.",ByDr. Stuart Gitlow,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Very Nice Remote,"If you are familiar with the harmony web-based setup, then setup is a breeze. I also have a Harmony Touch, so the setup was painless for me. I recall the Touch took about 20 min the first time, and subsequent trips to the setup for new devices or channel favorites was a snap.The screen interface difference with this unit, to me, is cleaner now. It is less cluttered than my Touch.Since I had the Touch setup, when I logged in to My Harmony, it asked me if I wanted to transfer the settings to the Ultimate One...well yes I do, thank you very much. Boom, just like that all my devices were set up. However, we just got an AppleTV, and as one might guess, it was a breeze to set that up too.For those that don't know, you enter your devices on the website, then create activites based on them. For example you have a tuner, a TV, a cable box, a game console, a Bluray player, and an AppleTV: for Watch TV:, you use the TV, the tuner, and the cable box. You let the Harmony know the HDMI (or other input) on the TV, that the tuner gets switched to cable/sat. Then the activity becomes, turn on the TV and make sure it is switched to the proper input, turn on the tuner and switch it to the proper output, and turn on the cable box. When you hit the off button all get turned off. Say while watching tv you want to watch a movie. Then the cable box gets turned off, the Bluray player gets turned on and the tuner switches its output mode to Blu ray/DVD. Same for gaming, radio, etc.After the unit is programmed your remote situation goes to a single remote and touch-screen goodness.My woman loves them. One remote, so no clutter. She wants to watch TV, she touches watch tv, then goes to our favorites to tap an icon of the channel's logo. It is quick an painless to bring up the soft number pad for change the channel manually.Most major functions of all devices are on the remote. I still need to get the device remotes out for things like firmware updates, or specialized functions, or to run specific apps like netflix.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"The Ultimate Series Is A Step Closer To... Well Ultimate. Don't Think Its Ultimate, But Still Best There Is Right Now","Are they there yet Nope. Still a pretty big a bite to setup, that has not changed much since I first started using the Harmony One eight or nine years ago and still use it. That model, I have no idea why it still works. It has been dropped, stepped on, kicked across the floor, my dog chewed on it, and it has came apart at the seams. I snap and bend it back into place and it still works. That is just amazing to me. Now to the remote at hand. Harmony Ultimate One IR.Ok what that means is that this is the version that does not have the remote hub that allows you to use the radio frequency to control tech in the next room, though walls. or in cabinets. You can get the remote hub separately here on Amazon, and I will be getting that because I am so tired at looking at all the receivers, players, and crap, I just can't stand it any longer. I want a clean look. Invisible tech.The Harmony Ultimate can control up to 15 devices, and Logitech has a library of nearly a quarter million different home entertainment products and their respective infrared commands. Even if your HDTV or Blu-ray player is obscure, you'll probably be able to control it with this remote.The downside on the buttons is that it has nothing to do with previous versions of Harmony Remotes so now you have to relearn the pattern you were used to. If you are first time Harmony customer no big deal. The only thing I have heard if you get the hub and I have personally not experienced this is that the hub may need to be reset from time to time.You control all your devices with one remote now and be able to make totally customizable control layouts and multi-device macros, then this Harmony One Ultimate will bend to your will. You just need a bit of patience and determination, plus a touch of imagination to turn this remote into anything you need a remote to be. It may take you some time to sit down and put all the entries in. Heck this thing can even control lighting and window blinds if thats your thing.In the end, I love touch screens. It makes everything so much more like your phone. And if you get the hub you can control your tech programed into the Harmony Ultimate from your phone with the downloadable app.Pain in the butt to program, great user experience if you have the patience and tenacity to put in what you need to control. Is that easy NO. If you have trouble doing technical things let your kid do it for you. Or find a twelve year old and bet them ten bucks they can't program it.Mission accomplished. If you have read these reviews on Amazon look into the negative reviews and you will most likely see that a logitech representative is reaching out to the reviewer to help them with a direct email or phone link. I like to see this from companiesUPDATE 6/10/14. I find the right Chanel toggle and left volume toggle too low on the remote for comfortable use.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Two stars is generous,"I paid over 160 for this piece of equipment that was supposed to make my life easier. It did nothing of the kind. I like many other of the reviews that I have read here have owned many Logitech remote controls in the past. They were simple they were easy to program and they were fuss-free. This unit has none of those attributes.When I receive this unit I immediately log on to the Logitech site and put the model numbers for my television, Soundbar and surround sound comma Blu-ray player and the sinking went without incident and I started using the new remote control. I started noticing deficiencies. It would raise and lower the volume on my soundbar but could not mute it. You could not skip 30 seconds at a time while watching the DVR as my Genie remote could do. You could not use any of the smart TV attributes of my Samsung 8000 series television. So today I called and was promised by a mr. Wang that at the end of his interminable message he would give me his Direct email address so that I can address any issues with him. Of course that never happened. During the 40 minutes that I waited on hold every one minute I would get a message telling me that I should go to their Community boards or to their website has all the information I would ever need would be there. Finally I got somebody on the phone he assured me that he would be able to fix my problem without any issues. So I followed his instructions and wasted another half hour of my life. Once the think was completed he asked me to press the activity watch TV. Instead my TV went off my Blu-ray player came on my soundbar became very loud and my genie DVR was shut off even though it is set up never to go off by the Logitech programming. At that point I think the gentleman for his help and explain to him that I will be typing a complain on my Logitech keyboard to Amazon using my Logitech mouse. I also explained that these would be the last Logitech products I would ever buy. He suggested that I consider buying their new 299 super duper remote control. I am declining his offer. There are better universal remote controls for a lot cheaper than this. Stay away from this unit.",ByAlain V Berrebi,2
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Not as good (overall) as other Harmony Remotes,"I want to love this remote, but I just can't. We got this for a great price and I debated on keeping it or not and finally decided to keep it. It is OK, but not near as good as the Harmony One in my opinion. The touch screen is a great idea, but really easy to hit things that you do not want to because it is right in the middle of the remote. I think it would have made more sense to put it at the top and have all the fixed buttons at the bottom like the Harmony One and then you would not have to reach over the touch screen to get to some frequently used buttons and accidentally hit the touchscreen. The layout of the buttons also does not seem as intuitive as older harmony remotes in my opinion and maybe that is more because I am used to the older layouts. Maybe if you are new to Harmony with this remote it would not be as big of a deal or noticeable for you.I also do not like that the bottom of the remote is curved so that it will rock from side to side with only a slight touch or movement when on a table or TV tray. I think it only hit the deck once so far and it did not cause any damage, but it is a significant concern (with hard floors) when you have a remote this expensive. All the other Harmony remotes that i have had did not have this issue (One, 880, 670). It may be of no concern if you have plush carpeted floors.I did like that the newer harmony software would automatically have all the channels available to pick favorites and it puts the icon for network on the touch screen. This was pretty slick and in older remotes there was no easy way to do this.I also do like that the charger puts the remote vertical and takes up a much smaller footprint. It is also much easier to see if the remote is in the charge from across the room. The thing i do not like, is I feel the battery life is much lower than either the Harmony One or the 880 (both discontinued). I have to charge it much more often.",ByITBob,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,this should be a functional prop on the upcoming new Star Trek sho.,"frankly, after having this 10 days and getting used to it i am utterly amazed. i transferred all my settings into it from my old 650 in minutes, which sure made things a lot quicker. after all these years they were still there, but it is a very good thing i had not forgotten that 7 year old, defunct e-mail address! i pressed the Watch TV activity, and my Sony HDTV, Onkyo receiver, Dish Hopper DVR, and Pinnacle subwoofer (i built an IR switch for it), all clicked on. it feels great in your hand and is lighter, and i like the felt-like, rough surface of the back. however i can't lay it on the chair arm face down to keep it from slipping off: there aren't enuf buttons to grip it (which ironically is good), and sometimes it will erroneously trigger the touch screen: a very minor problem, but it is less likely to damage itself falling on the carpet since it doesn't weigh much. i'd give it 5 stars, but i do not find the favorite channel screen useful. the icons are too small to see well w/o my reading glasses. i'd rather just go to my guide grid on the Dish Hopper and select the channels there, where i can see what is actually on. and it is difficult to scroll up and down w/o selecting the wrong channel by mistake. for that matter, that is a problem in selecting functions on the devices too. (it takes just the right touch.) however, i just love the gesture screen controlled by swipes taps. i wish it had the ability to be controlled by two fingers also, so i had 22 instead of 11 gestures, but the screen is a bit cramped for that (and it requires the hub and a smartphone which is overkill for my purposes), i reprogrammed 4 of the 11 (and use the buttons instead), several of which control the input of my PC in the bedroom (making this old Sony HDTV semi-smart w/ a wireless keyboard and mouse).the adjustable vibration feedback when you complete a command is simply splendid. there are also about 10 different screen backgrounds to choose from. you can even upload a pic when it is plugged into the computer and create one's own wallpaper/backgrounds.my major gripe about these Logitech remotes ( remotes in general), and i have had two before this one, is the buttons wear out, before the electronics, and they will not sell the keypad. i am a retired electronics technician, so i am capable of prying apart the old 650 and replacing it. (a classic example of planned obsolescence.) this is part of the reason i went the extra mile and got this and i am happy i did. (of course the main button that went bad controlled the Dish, and was one of the four around the little screen that are not mappable, so i could not transfer it to another.) this model is tight as a clam, and they claim the rechargeable lithium battery should never need replacing. well, it may last longer than i do, but all batteries eventually need replacing. the little stand that it recharges in, either by micro USB, or AC/DC voltage converter w/ micro USB is great. in no time one gets into the habit of putting it back in the stand, so one is less likely to misplace it, and it doesn't take very long to recharge. the 650 ate batteries for breakfast!this was refurbished/recertified, and came w/ a QC sticker on it. i got it elsewhere, and it looks and functions brand new. Logitech handles it w/ a warranty like it is a brand new one, and i don't think i am imagining this: their customer/tech service seems to have improved from what i remember. 80+ is a bargain, when one considers the retail price of a new one. this was refurbished/recertified, came w/ a QC sticker on it, and i obtained it elsewhere. it looks and functions as if brand new, off the shelf.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"OVERPRICED FRUSTRATION: Difficult to setup, too many unnecesary steps, flawed functionality...another Logitech fail","I've had a love/hate relationship with Harmony for the past 10 years...but no more second chances.Just like every Harmony I've ever owned, setup for this required a call to tech support. I'm fairly tech savvy, and this should be easy to set up, but it wasn't. And I know it wasn't me because it took tech support 30+ minutes and 7 syncs to make it function properly. Yes, properly is in quotes because even at its best, it was unimpressive.On my own using the software, syncing failed to load my activities into the remote. And again...it took tech support 7 syncs to make it work.Even after it was working properly, it was still frustrating to use:1) When switching between TV and SMART TV, it would power the speaker bar on and off. Does Logitech not understand that TV and SMART TV are not 2 separate devices and if you are switching from one to the other the sound should be left on With a remote this expensive I shouldn't have to dig out the speaker bar remote to turn it back on every time I switch activities.2) Lack of physical buttons for numbers is annoying. Any time I need the number pad I have to swipe to unlock, then swipe to get to the number pad. Technology is supposed to make processes faster...not slower. And yes, I know I can turn off the lock feature...but then every time I grab the remote it does something I don't want, and that something usually requires time-consuming troubleshooting.3) As I mentioned before, programming this remote is a nightmare (2+ hours) and even then it couldn't stand alone. I ran into problems only tech support could solve, and even then it took 30 minutes AFTER I had all the correct devices loaded. Please note that this was a simple configuration: Sony smart TV/Fios DVR/Samsung speaker bar. All less than 3 years old. After I returned this remote I bought a learning remote and endured programming every single button individually, and it still took a fraction of the time.4) There is no POWER button. Only an OFF button. You turn things on by selecting an activity. And as stated before...switching to a new activity powers things off that a remote this expensive should understand should be left on. If you are going to have a single OFF button that powers down everything with an activity button that turns everything back on, you should have an ON button for each device so you can quickly turn on any device that for whatever reason doesn't turn on when you fire up the system with an ACTIVITY button. And again...having to do an initial swipe to get to the ACTIVITIES just to turn the system on is annoying. Why does Logitech insist on writing code that slows down the power-on process5) You cannot utilize the Harmony software without plugging in the device. Why When things aren't working correctly (which is often) we should be able to fire up the app just to review the settings. Then, when you do plug the remote in, you have to wait for the remote and your PC to establish communication. Don't software engineers understand that we HATE waiting for technology to do things Especially when forced to plug in when we don't want to Speaking of plugging in, it is difficult with this remote. First off, there is a totally unnecessary door. That door gets in the way when you're trying to plug in, and plugging in is difficult enough already because the mini-USB port is deeply recessed inside the door. Do we really need to cause all this hassle just to hide a mini-USB port C'mon Logitech...don't you guys own cell phones Mini-USB doors are annoying and useless (which is why cell phones stopped using them). Try to keep up.6) Tech support is only good for 90 days. Based on my experience with this remote and 2 previous Harmony remotes, this means that any changes I make to my very simple home entertainment system will not work, and I will not be able to get help to make them work.A remote that costs well over 100 should assimilate my entertainment system like the Borg. It should be simple to set up, function extremely quickly/efficiently, and be highly intuitive. This device is just another example of technology that steals away hours of your your life that you will never get back.",ByMickey-D,1

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Very useful but needs a headphone jack,"This is a preliminary review after a week or so of use. I have now retired five remotes including my previous Logitech Harmony 510. The remote has a nice feel and is easy to operate. Occasionally, it skips. By that I mean, when I choose one thing, I get another, but infrequently and it is not a major problem.It takes a while to find something but I am sure this will improve with use. The learning curve is probably more steep than with the 510 and I'm still searching for things however, the menu layout is reasonably logical so that is a help. One thing I miss from my 510 is the ability to skip forward 30 seconds or backwards 10 seconds when watching a recording. That is an extremely useful tool that should be incorporated in the next model...or did I miss itAnother thing I really wish could be incorporated into remotes, including this one, is the feature on the Roku remote: a headset plugin capability. This is extremely useful since it eliminates long cords. Perhaps future models.Overall, I am quite (not yet very) happy with the HUO remote and expect to continue using it for a number of years.",BySailor,4

The vibration feedback deals with any concerns I had about using the remote without directly looking at it. Picking up the remote switches on the color screen, which switches off shortly after the remote is put down.

I just hope this one doesn't have battery or charging issues after 6 months -1 year like all of other ones I have owned. Keeping my fingers crossed!",ByAmazon Customer,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Smart Dedicated Remote. Nothing Better Than Having a Dedicated Remote With Physical Buttons Touchscreen,"Honestly, this remote is pretty great. Some argue about how the play/pause buttons are at the top but I had no issue using it that way. Besides, most of what I tried let's me use the Ok and directional buttons as play/pause, fastforward/rewind. The touch screen is pretty responsive and there isn't much delay accessing your devices or activities. What sucks is that there is a limitation of 15 device no matter if you add more of these remotes or add a hub, you'll get the maximum amount from the device that has the maximum limit. I wish the 8 device limit from my harmony hub combined with this harmony remote giving me a total of 23 devices. But nope Logitech just wants you to buy one of the expensive remotes to have the 15 limit. Even the Elite has a maximum of 15. So the maximum you could get from the most expensive remote is also 15. They should have at least doubled that as they did with the 8 limits.Before I begin, I would like to say this is my first time owning a smart universal remote. I had one or two or so cheap universal remotes before. So this is a bigger difference.Battery: Charge it for four hours. Use it for about 72 hours. Plenty of time to use this imo. Just leave it on charge when you sleep and you'll be good to go throughout the day. It has a charging indicator on the screen that let's you know when charging and fully charged. There is a battery life indicator on the top right of the screen when the remote is out of lock screen. You can charge this two ways. It has a cradle but you can also use the micro USB port below the remote to charge it up. (The micro USB port is mostly just there to setup the remote through PC but you can charge it through micro USB port as well.)Design: The remote looks beauitful. Though, it could have been better. I do agree with people that the play/pause, fastforward/rewind buttons should have been at the bottom. But honestly that isn't an issue as most of the stuff I've tried lets you use the directional and ok button as play/pause, fastforward/rewind. But either way it's pretty easy to use and feels nice in the hands. I love having a remote that has both a touchscreen and physical buttons. Touchscreen adds more functionality and having physical buttons just feels better pressing on them. Number keys would have been nice but really not needed if you have ditched cable and don't plan on having an antenna. And it doesn't take much effort looking at the touchscreen when entering the numbers. I know some people don't like that but at least it's just 9 numbers and not an entire alphabet. :)Interface: Not much could be done with an interface when the screen is small. It's nice for a universal remote (much better than what smart universal remotes had before). You can change the background from a preset or upload your own through the computer. Overall, it's pretty easy to use and really no delay from going device to device.Touch screen: Like I mentioned before, the touch screen is pretty responsive. If you don't want to accidentally touch the touch screen, it's best to put the lock screen. So you can just swipe the lock screen when you want to use it and you don't accidentally end up pressing any of the touchscreen buttons when you meant to touch the physical buttons etc.Customization: You can arrange the order of devices. For example if you want TV all the way at top you can drag it to all the way at the top when you are in edit mode. Same with activities. What you can't arrange is Smart Home devices that are in the Plug/Lights folders. You can arrange where Plugs and Lights go but not the devices themselves in the Plugs and Lights folder. Kinda sucks as you can do that with the Harmony app but not on the remote. Also, the arrangement you set in the Harmony app doesn't get applied to the remote. You have to do the arrangement separately on both the app and remote. Also as I said before you can also change the background image to a selection from the preset or upload your own through the computer. Customization is great but could be better. At least it's there. :)Activities/Favorites: You setup activities which lets you can turn on multiple things at once. You can also for example access your favorite channels or if you have a Roku your favorite apps. It seems like there is only integration with Roku when it comes to Alexa and Favorites section. So for example you can launch Netflix from the Netflix icon in the favorite sections once you hit the Roku activity.Limitations: It kind of sucks that there is a device limitation of 15 devices only. I'm sure they could have gone with a much higher limit. I have a IR+RF Hub called Broadlink RM Pro that doesn't have this kind of annoying limit and it's much cheaper than this remote and harmony hub. It's only under 40 and that's when it's not on sale. I also wish they would have let us combined devices in order to increase our limits such as if you have the harmony hub which carries only 8 devices you'll have 8 + 15 from this harmony remote giving you a total device limit of 23. The nice thing though is there does not seem to be a limit of devices you can setup for SmatHome such as if you have SmartThings linked, you can pretty much put as many devices as you like.Price: It's a pretty expensive remote. It's hard to put 200 on this remote. I guess if I paid 200 for this remote, I would have rated this differently. But since I got this during the holidays for 100, it's a much better experience to me just because of that.Support: Logitech has email, live chat and phone support. So you have many options to chat with them. And they usually respond back and take care of your problems pretty well.Overall: I would recommend this product when it's on sale for 100 or less. As 200 is too much to ask for. I like this over using a smartphone as a remote because it's nice having a device that is dedicated as a remote only and nothing else. Smartphones have too much going for it and the lack of physical buttons don't make it as nicer to use as a dedicated remote. Even if you voice control for everything (Echo/Google Home), using a remote is sometimes nicer. I prefer changing the volume through remote rather then through Alexa but I prefer turning on the TV through Alexa through anything else. The amount of customization is nice but could be better. Having the ability to charge the remote two ways (Micro USB and cradle) is also nice. The remote has a nice design, feels good in the hands but the device limitations are for the most part the weakest point. I could get away with the other issues as they aren't such big issues but I would have loved to control more devices without having to find workarounds. Overall, I would recommend this remote only when it's 100 or less. I can't see myself putting 200 for any remote. (But who knows maybe I will)",ByBlank,4

We have a Denon receiver, Sony TV, ATT Cable Box, Apple TV, and a Mac Mini in our entertainment center. I was able to successfully program the remote for all of these devices and setup the sequences so that things would turn on and go to the right input.The problem was that it didn't work 100 of the time. More than 50 of the time one device or another would fail to turn on (or off), or the input wouldn't go to the right setting.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Works great for me,"I never thought I could get excited over a remote control, but I did with this one. First of all, let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon, but I took the plunge and so far I'm not regretting it. This is my first Harmony remote, so I obviously can't make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review.It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software. That was a breeze, but it's important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other. All my components were supported by the remote, so no problems there. I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen. A nice touch, though not very important.Once the first sync from software to remote is completed, the remote will work on your system. As opposed to the previous situation, where you had four remotes lying around, you will now hit one button ('activity') and your TV, AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once. Great! At first this does not work flawlessly. For instance, you hit 'Watch TV' and everything might come on, but the AV receiver won't be on the right channel. The great thing about this remote, though, is that it learns on the job: It will ask you if the function performed as desired, and if not, how it can improve. After my initial use with every component, these flaws were pretty much ironed out. I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever.One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you've been fooling around with your equipment behind its back. Turned off your TV by hand using that device's own power button The Harmony doesn't know, so when you switch everything off through the remote (again: just ONE button), your TV will come back on again. You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on/off buttons for the individual components. You'll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity, so there's an initial time investment involved. And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote, so you'll have to memorize everything. All in all this is not ideal.If you want to nitpick, a few other minor cons are: 1) the sluggish touchscreen and 2) slightly flimsy buttons. This is nothing I can get worked up about.None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement. I'm very happy with this product. I'm still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and, subsequently, the longevity of this remote. Time will tell, and I'll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so. So far I'd highly recommend it. Great product!",ByMark Vandenberg,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Great Remote for Cable Cutters, Good for Everyone Else","While this is my first day using it, I must say that I love this remote. Many of the issues that other users have cited have been solved. For instance, the touchscreen locks after inactivity, so you can easily press buttons above the screen without worrying about accidentally pressing commands on the touch screen. I also love that I can change per-device command delays, screen brightness and button backlighting. It's also worth noting that the picture shown includes older firmware. The newer firmware looks more modern and sleek, and like it's predecessors, can control the Xbox One and Xbox 360. I couldn't get my old remote to do that. The dock is also pretty cool.That said, there are a few cons:- The top buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. They can be hard to get to.- The remote comes with a pre-set button-press delay of 0.1 seconds. At first, I thought the remote was just slow at processing commands, but it's actually a setting so you don't confuse older components. I wish it was more obvious so I would have changed it sooner to remove that annoyance.- There are no physical number buttons on this remote. This does not affect me as I do not have cable/dish/antenna, but for those who do, this could be an annoyance.- This one's weird: I wish it were heavier. I'm coming from a Yamaha universal that came from my RX-V575 and was pretty great, and was also heavier. I wish this remote was heavier seeing as it's more powerful and much more expensive. If I'm going to spend 200+ on a remote, it should feel substantial in my hand.All in all, none of those cons were enough to remove even one star. This is (by far) the best remote I've ever owned.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,I love this thing,"WOW! I love this thing. This is my 4th Harmony , 2 Harmony One's, 1 Harmony 650, and this new Ultimate One. They have all been great, but the new Ultimate is just that, ULTIMATE. It is incredibly simple to setup and use. It even lists all of the cable channels for most cable companies along with their station number and icon when you setup your favorites, point and click. Building command sets or macro's is a very simple process if you even need that, and they have simplified setting up special keys on the keyboard and screen, it is great! Not a glitch during setup. If you like me want to copy your old configuration from the old to the new, it can do that, however it is not able to transfer favorites for you, or special key assignments, but with the new process for adding favorites and the fact that you get more favorites it is a snap.The new thing I like most is the screen gestures. Learning them makes the remote incredibly easy to use. You don't even have to look down at the remote for most common changes. I have seen several bad reviews on this remote on Amazon.

This version is a significant downgrade. The buttons have far less customization, the our old remote. The layout of the buttons on the remote lack a comfortable feel and placement. The removal of the number buttons in favor of the touch screen might not seem like a big deal. But instead of being about to press in 300 for your favorite channel you now need to: Touch the Screen Swipe to unlock If it doesn't come up to the number screen you have to flip through the screens to find the numbers Then enter the 300Who at Logitech thought doubling the number of keystrokes needed made any sense at all I certainly don't!I will say, this remote does eliminate the need for multiple remotes.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Terrible design: not an upgrade,"I am a Harmony user, and decided I needed to replace my trusty Harmony One as the buttons have been worn off and the mute button sometimes does not work. SO I picked up the Ultimate. This is the replacement, right It's probably better, right I had read about some people having issues with the button placement and others saying it was no big deal, so I got one. I set it up (instantly using the Harmony software. No one does this better IMO) and started using it. It sucked. The touch screen was slow, much too slow to control a DVR. The hard button placement is STUPID, making them difficult to use, and there is no numeric keypad. Well yes, there is a soft keypad three swipes away on the touch screen, but it's not as fast nor as easy as real buttons. OK, I thought, I am just suffering through a learning curve. I'll get used to it and things will get better. So I lived with it for two months. Struggled with it, I should say. This thing is useless to properly control a DVR. The hard buttons are in the absolute wrong location. The touch screen gesture control works only when it decides to work (and usually if you set the remote down and inadvertently do something when your hand moves over the face.) And speaking of setting it down, whoever designed this has never used a remote control in the real world. The bottom is not flat. Yes, it can feel nice in your hand, yes the charging stand is good, but try setting the remote on a table, or worse yet on the curved arm of an easy chair, and watch it roll over. After two months of almost slamming this thing against the wall on numerous occasions, I put it in the drawer and re-charged my old design One. Ah. Now I can relax again when I watch TV.

First, It frequently drops the correct HDMI cable setting when I switch directly from cable TV (HDMI 1) input to Roku (HDMI 2) input for streaming video input (Netflix or Amazon). It's easily fixable, but it's still a pain. Also, I miss a number key pad instead of using the video keypad input which often doesn't work.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,It is not getting better all the time.,"I purchased this to replace my Harmony one, which I loved. This remote was more expensive and vastly inferior. The ergonomics are terrible. The remote cannot be operated effectively with one hand. To reach the hard buttons at the top, one invariably activates the touch screen by mistake. In general, there are too few hard buttons (like HELP) requiring you to look down at the touch screen unnecessarily. In addition, the touch screen is not sensitive enough and frequently does not recognize taps. The swipe feature (which is nice in theory) is also not sensitive and often requires do-overs. After 4 months of babying (i.e., not letting the kids use it), the top half of the touch screen no longer worked at all. Subsequently found out that free technical support in the US is only available for 90 days (unlike Europe and Asia, which have 2 years and 1 year free phone support respectively). Without technical support, I was close to returning this, but with a little self-help persistence on the website, I was able to figure out how to reboot it (which solved the problem). Still, it should not have to be this difficult. Charging for technical support during the warranty period is a poor business model. Hope this company gets its act back together.",ByJohn F,2

My last one was an 880. I simply wore the other two out (wishing the buttons were a little more robust). I am a big fan of Harmony. I had great expectations of this one but it has let me down. The feel is good, the layout looks good but it is unbalanced and the touch screen just simply sucks. It is a very poor quality touch screen. I don't need to go on and on about it. Luckily, I bought this from Costco and I was able to return it easily. I am looking to buy the 700 online even though it is no longer being made by Logitech.",ByWorking Hard,2
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Wow! What happened Harmony,"I've been using Harmony remotes for many years. I remember when there was no 90 day tech support deadline that's how far back I go. I purchased the new Ultimate One remote and installed the newer on line software. With this, I was able to set my remote up nicely. My old Harmony One worked but not as well as this new remote. My devices responded quicker and if it did not pick up a function the first time, I just selected Help and once it picked up that function, it actually remembered it from then on which the older remote did not do. I also bought the Hub. This is where my problems began. The Hub setup quite nicely with the new remote and actually made the remote work better, especially at longer distances. The only problem, at first, that I encountered was the Wi-Fi would not pick up so I called tech support. I have never had an issue with tech support within the 90 days allotted period but after 90 days you better have a credit card they will not help you, fact! Anyway, I was on the phone for over an hour and thirty minutes but they count not get the Hub to work with Wi-Fi so they escalated it up to level 2 support. She told me that they would contact me within 24 to 48 hours. That was around 11:30am on a Friday morning. Five days later on Wednesday around 9:05am I called them back requesting level 2 support. They told me that level 2 was busy and that they would call me back in just a few minutes. I heard nothing back that day. The next morning, Thursday, around 9:20am I called back and requested level 2 tech support. Mike told me that they were busy and that he would certainly have them call me back in a few minutes. At that point I told Mike that if level 2 did not call me back, that day, that I would be very upset. Mike said no problem and ended the conversation. Surprise! No call back that day either. So I called back on Friday morning around 10:20am and this time I was a little upset. I spoke to Kevin who read the notes from the day before and said he didn't understand why I was upset because the notes said that the second line tech was out on Thursday and that I was told that they would contact me on Friday. This was news to me. So it appears that Harmony tech support level one write down whatever note covers their butt but not necessarily the truth. Kevin said he would have a 2nd line tech call me right back. I said ok never thinking that I would ever receive a call back but to my surprise CJ called and we were able to start addressing the issues. After blowing out my perfect working remote, Ultimate One, and installing new software, firmware and the remote setup info the remote stopped working properly. The Hub issue was never fixed so I ended up calling Amazon, love Amazon, who offered me a refund or replacement. I actually took the replacement due to the fact that the remote originally worked so well. I am waiting for them to arrive and I will update you on what happens from here................................to be continued",ByCopperhead,2

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Fantastic product - wish I had sprung for this sooner!,"Brilliant product. I have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a AV receiver, Roku, DVD, and fairly new Motorola DVR from FiOS and this configured and handled them all perfectly - the first time I set it up.The genius of the product is that it's programmed online and Logitech has thousands of components already identified - and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a look-up utility on their site. I wasn't sure about my Pioneer VSX-33TX THX receiver as it's probably 10 years old, but it was no problem. You connect the remote to your computer, Windows 7 found the drivers online without issue, then go to the Logitech setup site and create an account if you don't already have one. Then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have. If your setup is simple that may be all you need to do, but they take care of multiple 'keypress' needs very elegantly. For example, to play a DVD I have to change the plasma display to HDMI 2, set the AV receiver to DVD input, then turn on the DVD. Logitech's setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that I'd probably be using so all I needed to do was to confirm and save. Then a single touch to the onscreen display on the Harmony does it all.Be aware that like most IR remotes, it wants a pretty straight line-of-site to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal. My components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about 12 feet from our seating area and remote control wasn't a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet. If you're not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming, pick up and install an IR repeater and it will solve that problem.Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this device. The ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed. The 200 seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical button-only remote can take hours and I had this set up in 15 minutes, it quickly seems like money well spent.",ByGlenn,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Not so harmonious,"My main complaint is the touch screen. Using it to control Tivo playback is really terrible: for instance, you are fast-forwarding and then you touch the screen to have it resume play good luck with that. You usually have to tap the screen multiple times before it resumes play, and then you have to rewind and go through the same problem again. It is best at that point to use the physical buttons. The only good thing about this remote is putting your favorite station's icons on the touch screen. Also, I entered the required Tive motel number for the online setup of the remote and when I use the Harmony to turn my Samsung TV on, it not only turns the TV on, but it opens up one of the TV's dialogs automatically. If you decide to use your Tivo or the TV's remote to turn the TV on, but you would like to use the Harmony's touch screen for it's favorite stations, there is no way to do that you wind--up having to turn your TV off first and then having to use the Harmony to turn the TV back on to have access to the favorites on the touch screen.",Byteslercpa,2

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Maybe, Maybe Not But Logitech Stands Behind Their Product","To preface my review, I am not a technophobe and have programmed other Harmony remotes.After hours of programming and re-reprogramming the remote it still does not operate properly. When I think I have the problem solved the remote fails to perform a basic function like turning on or off my devices. Based on my experience this remote is not as easy as 1-2-3-4 to set up. This is a shame because the remote has some really nice features but all the great features in the world are of no value if the remote doesn't perform basic functions.You might wonder why not call customer service. I did and here is my experience. The bright spot about contacting customer service was that I was able to reach someone without waiting an hour to speak with someone. Also I called at 4:30 pm a half-hour before the service center closes and the customer serve rep worked with me past closing time. Bottom line was the customer service rep attempted to help me and went as far as remotely changing settings on the remote on-line which only made the problem worse. At one point I had to take a quick call and explained that I would put the rep on hold and be right back. As soon as I put the call on hold the rep hung up. No call back in case it was an accidental disconnect. I called back only to find the service center was closed. I was left standing there with my remote in my hand. A remote that did not operate. I was able to re-program the remote so it could operate albeit not properly.I can't recommend this product and urge you not to purchase this product. Clearly the product does not work as advertised and their customer service is pathetic. I will contact customer no-service this week when i have the time and update this review. But in the meantime don't waste your time or money on this remote.Update -We'll it has been almost a week since I wrote my review. Just to be clear none of my components or TV are concealed and well within range. Someone from Logitech contacted me via email (no phone). Unfortunately I am extremely busy during the week and could not speak to Ian Crowe although I did call Logitech in California and left a voice mail for Ian this afternoon. I tried to work with Logitech's customer no-service today. I spoke to someone off-shore somewhere. No help. In fact he tried to tell me my remote was an RF remote. Just to make sure this tech rep was wrong I called Vizio to ensure the remote was an IR remote. It is. Sadly I am still where I was last week. Sending me an email offering to help me is great but I need solutions not empty offers to help. Ian please call me.2nd Update - I have been working with Logitech's Senior Manager for Customer Service in the Bay Area, for the past two Fridays. It looks like the problem has been solved (crossing my fingers). I really appreciate the time and effort that Ian has made to make things right. Logitech is sending an optional hub to try in case the current fix does not work. If I have to return the remote Ian has promised a refund even if I return the remote after 30 days. I hope I don't have to use the hub or return the remote. If I have to return the remote it is not because of Logitech's not trying. I really believe that Ian has gone above and beyond what would be expected.The Bottom Line: This remote might be buggy depending on your AV equipment. But when it works, it works great. So far I really like using the remote. I especially like the favorites screen. I think my tech challenged wife will be able to use the remote too. Logitech has stepped up and helped make a bad situation a good one. I would recommend Logitech to a friend or family member. I changed the title of my review and gave the remote 3 stars from 1 star. Give this a product a shot understanding there could be a problem but Logitech will work with you to make it right. I hope the current fix works and I won't have to return the remote it really is great to use.",ByMichael Manchester,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Not a heads up device,"I had a Harmony 880 that I loved and used to control TV, sound system with audio inputs and a WDTV media device. Had it programmed for TV viewing, media streaming both from WDTV and Amazon Fire TV Stick, radio, audio input from mp3 player and audio input and monitor from computer. The 880 was great with display screen and physical buttons. After a times thru display was unnecessary just pick the buttons for what I wanted to do. After nearly 5 years the buttons finally wore out and I replaced it with this one. I was able to transfer all my devices and most of my activities from the 880 after finally digging up the password for Harmony device web account. Much of the control was transferred from physical buttons to touch screen which seems a bit tricky to control. I have not had it long enough to see if I can reprogram buttons for activities to regain some the functionality of old remote. Even if it can be programmed to us the buttons seems like it will still require a lot of looking at the remotes screen rather than keeping my eyes on the big screen. But I guess that's progress and soon there won't be buttons or screen just speech and then brain wave scan which will be replaced with a logarithm based on our habits and what we did in the past that was selected by a logarithm.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Love it,"After reading a lot of reviews both the good and bad. I went and ordered this one. I have had it about a week and this is the second Logitech remote. I honestly did not program the first Logitech remote, my husband did, he is not tech savvy at all, I have to teach him all the tricks with any device.So when he say this new one, he said it's up to me. That being said, I am not an expert and have at times had to result to calling my son to get me through the tech stuff. Well I will say it was very easy to program. But, I did have a lot of my devices info prior to starting the programming. I have 8 devices, DIRECTV, Apple TV, Roku, Yamaha receiver, Samsung, iPod dock to name a few. The remote controls all the devices with no issue.Now some complained about the buttons, the touch screen, swipe and even the vibration with touching. I turned off the vibration that fixed that. The touch of buttons on the touch screen might have a second or two lag in response time, but really not that bad. Compare it to what time takes to change between controllers, its less then that. The biggest thing is just getting used to having JUST ONE controller, learning to navigate between the devices with just 1 controller. Same with the gesture swipe it will take a bit getting used to just like anything else you have to learn. So far it easy for everyone in the family to use. Best thing my husband likes is the sleep mode for the touchscreen, it keeps from accidentally changing the channel or device. The only complaint would be the bump in the back for you fingers, I guess that is what it is for, it gets in the way at times. If things change about what I think I will add it, but so far I would recomend to anyone that has A lot of devices and wants just one controller",ByAnita Taylor,5

Easy to setup!,"Very easy to program! Just put in your devices by model number and tell it where everything is connected (e.g. DVD is on input 1 on the TV). The software download from the Internet. Worked great on my MacBook Pro 15 (late 2013). You need to plug in the remote to program it (they call it sync) once everything is setup and it includes a USB to micro USB cable, so if you have a laptop with the new USB C connector, you will need to use an adaptor or buy a new cable, so new MacBook Pro (late 2016+) and MacBook users will need to figure out a cable solution.The Ultime One is IR, it doesn't include the RF base, but the base can be bought separately at a later date if you decide you need RF.We have Roku 3 and 4 players, which use RF on their included remotes, however the Roku player can receive IR too, but it's not as responsive as it is with RF. You also need to point the remote at the player, which you may not be used to if you use the Roku remote a lot. My daughter complained at first but I removed the battery from the old tv and Roku remotes (so they don't leak over time) and put them away, so she has to use the Logitech. After a few days she adapted to having to point the remote. Hopefully your significant other or kids are as flexible )The touch screen is responsive and easy to use. You can swipe over from the actions screen to the gesture screen and use it to easily raise or lower the volume (swipe up or down on the screen instead of using the volume up down buttons). It works great and so far I'm very happy with the purchase.1 star reduction because of the lower IR output requiring aiming more to use it.",ByRichard S,4

The Ultimate One was unable to control a Pioneer Elite TV, a Linksys DMA 2200 media center extender, and to understand that I have my media center PC always on. Marred by several device incompatibility and by awful, awful design: how practical is it to have the Play/Pause Skip/Back buttons on top To use the playback controls means pushing buttons at the tip of the remote, so it is not firmly in your hand. Therefore, no one-hand wielding and thumb controls: you need one hand to hold the remote steady and the other to push buttons. The ffwd/skipfwd button combo is not good, despite the haptic feedback, as the extended press is a waste of time and not very accurate because of lag. The touchscreen menus are confusing, bare and unappealing. The scrolling system not very sensitive. I do not want to have to swipe the touchscreen every time I want to access some info or programmed function. It's just another annoying step. There are a hundred more negative things I could say about it. I strongly disliked it, despite being a fan of the half dozen other Harmony remotes that I have programmed over nearly ten years.",ByLuckyLuke,1

Button layout is a little odd with the play/stop/etc. buttons at top and touch screen is a little slow, at least compared to phones and tablets. Charging dock is nice.NOTE that this remote will NOT control devices over RF (e.g. Roku players) or Bluetooth (e.g. Playstation). That functionality requires a separate 100 hub, which can also be extended to control Zigbee and other types of IoT devices (approximately another 100).NOTE that this remote requires a computer to set up, otherwise it is just an expensive paperweight. Be sure to check the OS requirements. Also requires downloading software from Harmony, which went without a hitch once I disabled my VPN. For some reason it refused to download the program files on the VPN and gave the usual check that you are connected to the Internet advice. Turned out to be half right.Setup was easy.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,This is the worst Harmony I've ever used,"This is the worst Harmony I've ever used. It's an ergonomic disaster with little that is done right. It is however still a Harmony, so it somehow salvages 3 stars for what they all do right.It seemed nice in the box, and it was a breeze transferring everything from my Harmony 700 to this via the My Harmony program. The weight and balance are good and the charging cradle works well. Everything else ranges from bad to worse.Maybe one day the screen/pad will do what I need it to do, but for now it's rubbish and it's in the location where the most used buttons should be. As a result those buttons are below (4 way controller, volume, channel, etc... or above (play, pause, etc...). Ugh! Worse yet the screen/pad isn't just dead space (honestly it would be better if it were), rather it's live. That can be ok when it's acting like a touch pad with various taps and swipes to do things (it never works that well, but I see what they're trying to do), but it's a disaster when it's live with functions that are so seldom used there's no dedicated button. So channel favorites, random superfluous functions, etc get accidentally pressed. Even then they hardly work in the case of the favorites with my Motorola cable box running Uverse (95 of the time 2 or 3 of the 4 digits are recognized). When you avoid that pad the other buttons are cramped and arranged poorly even within their poor locations. The 4 way pad is small, as are the play and pause buttons and the skip and fast forward buttons are shared. Of all the sacrifices made for the screen/pad, those red, green, yellow, and blue buttons you never use are still there--UGH!!!!!Move the screen up, move the key buttons where the fingers land, kill the color keyed buttons that don't ever do s***, and try again. Oh and the battery life sucks too. Please make a new flagship controller ala the Harmony One (original) 880, etc...

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Nice job, Logitech! Finally a remote that works the way I want it to!","We had an older Logitech remote that was programmable through their web app. The puppy decided he liked the remote better than we did, and although it still worked after the application of some CSI-style, crime-scene reconstruction forensics and super glue, it was time for a new remote now that he had grown up.This remote and the computer-based app is remarkable. If you can follow simple directions, the application walks you through each step. I write instruction and repair procedures, and I can tell you that the instructions in the app make it easy to get the remote working how you like. well done, Logitech!You Begin by entering the brand and model number of each device. On one of the older devices it gave a screen message that there are control variations with that model and to consult them if there was a problem. It also popped up that the Roku was IR and RF and that this remote was only IR. It even handled an old VCR and a not-quite-as-old DVD recorder. Ya... we're old. So whatOnce all your devices are entered you create Activities. For example, for watching TV we use our receiver, the LCD TV and the antenna. It even asks if we wanted the Onkyo or the TV to control the volume and what input on the TV to use for this activity and what input on the receiver. I was easily able to create an FM activity to listen to the radio in the morning. With dreary morning eyes, just we only have to press the FM screen icon in the activities window on the touch screen.Additionally, I created two custom activities- one for watching HULU and one for watching NETFLIX using our Roku3. I was able to customize it so that the remote would start the TV, Start the Onkyo, and select the Roku. At that point it sent the signals to emulate remote key selections for HOME/Click Right/click Right/OK to get to Hulu. I did much the same for Netflix. I found that these two custom Activities would not go back and forth between the two. The solution was to add a two second delay between HOME and go right. The app made that easy as one of the custom items which could be selected in the app was ADD DELAY and you can select the length of the delay as well. Handy for troubleshooting should it become necessary. The custom items (such as the button presses) can be reordered when programming them as well. In that way, when I found the two custom Activities were not working properly I went back into the app, added a delay, and then moved the delay up to just after Home.If you are not sure, you can download the MyHarmony desktop software at the Logitech website and program in all the various devices to see how it works before even purchasing the remote.Although I gave it five stars, it is not perfect:- One problem I had with the last Harmony remote model and this one as well is that it is made to fit in your hand. Unfortunately, that same ergonomic design makes it very difficult to click something as simple as Mute when the remote is sitting on the table.- Allowing the application to auto-program the favorite channels will work fine for most people, but if you live in a rural area and get channels from different directions (like when using an antenna rotor), you can't automatically add the channels from both directions. Pick one or the other. The solution is to add the channels you watch manually, and that can be done right on the remote. Afterwards, synch the remote on the computer and they will be saved there was well.- Finally, the battery is not meant to be user replaceable, but a search on YouTube will show you that it can be done fairly easily, just in case the battery dies before the remote does.If I had known these things before I bought it, would it have changed my mind! No. I have been writing reviews in the coffee industry for nearly 16 years and try to be balanced in my appraisals. This is why I added the above.This model is evidently no longer for sale at Logitech, and I hope that this is not an indication that it is discontinued as that would be too bad. If you don't need the home automation and smart phone app, this remote might just be what you are looking for. We got ours as a refurb for under 120, delivered with sales tax. What a deal!",ByR. Glass,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,I really hate this remote.,"I upgraded to this from a Harmony One, which I loved but was just starting to feel kind of old. I read a lot of reviews and complaints about this model's button layout. I figured people were just exagerating, how hard can it be to learn a new layout and get used to the play-pause controls being at the top of the remote instead of the middle. You have to hold the remote by the top to use the commands, but thats not the big problem for me. Instead its the brain dead designers that put the power button millimeters above the similarly shaped rewind button. The number of times I've accidently shut my whole system off while trying to quickly rewind something... extremely frustrating.Another issue with holding the remote at the top to use the play-pause controls is that your thumb or hand will often press the touch screen. This is a design flaw they tried to solve by putting a lock on the touch screen. When the touch screen activates you have to slide the lock screen over to use the touch buttons. This got old real fast, it adds an annoying extra step to trying to use your fancy (supposedly) convienent universal remote. Disabling the lock screen, however, means that my remote's touch screen is constantly ending up on the numeric or favorites page for some reason. Two pages I never use and wish I could just turn off or hide, but cant.And finally, the biggest problem with this remote. The battery. The Harmony One's battery lasted forever and when it was running low, the remote would smartly remind you to recharge it. This new Harmony lasts a few days if youre lucky, and has no charging reminder. So I'll use it for two days the battery indicator around 70, then the next days its completely dead and wont even turn on. So you cant use your remote until its gotten enough charge to function. If you remember to ALWAYS put the remote on the charger when youre not using it, this wont be an issue. But for me its a constant and frustrating problem with an overall poorly designed and bad upgrade of a once excellent universal remote.",ByJ. Schmidt,2

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Competent but for the premium price lacking premium functionality,"Okay, semi expert here. This is my fourth Harmony universal remote in about ten years. Perhaps that leads to conclusions about issues of longevity I'm a little torn on that. Yes, they do get daily work, but a little more in the build quality, especially for the steep price, seems warranted. Battery life on the previous models was also not good - I am talking about rechargeable models.Sadly, nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech/Harmony. If I am wrong please tell me in the comments - I am willing to switch!While easy to use, easy to set up is not the same thing. If you are tech savvy, it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first, getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear, second, knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs. Advice, write it down and keep it on file. That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge. Unlike my last model, the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off. I had to customize button settings for my cable box (FIOS) to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand - that's right, no default button set up for On Demand. In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away, but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need. Back to cable, but some often used functions, like search, are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote. We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer, but again, for 250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing. Not to be AV elitist, but I don't think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out 250 for a remote. We want ease of use, but also versatility. FYI, I am running this with a HD TV, audio video receiver and a 5.1 surround setup, FIOS cable box, Roku 4, blueray DVD player and (for old family stuff I am working to convert) an actual VHS VCR!P.S. Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful - volume buttons are easier to use. Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality. Form factor/ergonomics is not the best either. Volume, channel, guide - highly used buttons not in a natural position for the hand. Hire a real Human Factors person please!",ByCommander Schlock,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,One Remote to rule them all!!,"Wow! that sums up this product.My better half was complaining the other day that our entertainment system is too complicated for her and how she hates having to use four different remotes and turn on three different devices just to watch a DVD or Bluray movie. So to make her life easier (Happy Wife Happy Life) I began to research and look into a good solid universal remote to control my media devices in a more user friendly way. I looked at several different Harmony models and a few of the others on the market.My System consists of a LG Flat screen, Sony Receiver, Sony Bluray player, Scientific Atlanta Cable box with DVR, Apple TV, Nintendo Wii, and a Sony Playstation 3.I needed a remote that would enable me to control all of these as well as have room for anything else I may add down the line. The programability and functions this remote offered seemed to fit the bill perfectly. So I ordered it.Took it out of the Apple inspired package and connected it to my Macbook Pro upon delivery. Downloaded the app from the website and it walked me thru the entire set up and programming process within minutes. i got the actions set up exactly how i wanted them, said what devices need to turn on and what inputs need to be switched, and it was done. 3 minutes for the remote to sync up from the computer and it was ready to go.First test showed this product does exactly what it says it does. And it just works. the remote feels good in the hand and I personally do not find the button placement to be awkward at all for the hard keys. Its a very sleek looking piece and most importantly does as advertised and does away with numerous remotes.I select Watch Apple TV action on the touch screen and it turns on the Apple TV, switches the receiver to the correct input and away it goes.Select Watch TV it kicks on the Cable box, switches to the correct input, and away we go.Yes its a little pricey, but its worth every penny.",ByScott H,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Touch screen too slow to reply to commands,This is my fifth Harmony remote and the first one I have not been happy with. I thought I would like the touch screen functionality but it just didn't work for me. It was too slow to respond to the commands. For example I would pull up they key pad and want to go to channel 1210. It would take about three tries to get the remote to respond to the commands. I would press 1-2-1-0 and it would not register one of the numbers. I guess I just miss the actual number pad with raised buttons where you can use it without having to look at the remote.Well why not just use the favorite channel functionality and just press one button to go to your desired channel I tried this too.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Problems seem to be fixed by new firmware,"Almost a month ago I paid over 1,000 for four hub based Harmony Logitech Remotes: Two Ultimate Home remotes (one white and one black) and one Ultimate One upgraded with the Smart Control and Ultimate Hub add-on.I have three A/V systems - in my bedroom, home gym and family room. I used the Ultimate One + Smart Control combination in my bedroom so that my wife and I could each have a remote on our side of the bed that would stay in sync with each other.I must say that the units are beautifully packaged and have a very attractive design. They feel good in the hand. I am somewhat of a techie and have had various learning/universal remotes over the years, and did not find the setup difficult. In fact, compared to past remotes in which setup involved hours of button pushing, the Harmony setup was a breeze. I was very impressed by the GUI interface - though the process of adding/editing devices and activities was agonizingly slow at times because of the sluggish slow-mo response of the iOS app during the setup stage.I was so excited to set-up and deploy these remotes in the three rooms and happy to tell my family about the new convenience we would all enjoy - no longer having to juggle multiple remotes and devices in each room.Everything seemed to work perfectly running the remotes through their paces after installation.Unfortunately the honeymoon did not last long. The first night I really used the remote to watch a movie I noticed there were times when I tried to pause or rewind the playback, and the commands did not work - the remote was frozen-up. Then, 10 to 30 seconds later the commands I had given would be executed and the movie would start executing the commands - the movie would pause, rewind, etc. Since I had pushed the buttons repeatedly the result was somewhat comical as the TV seemed spontaneously to be pausing, fast forwarding, etc. as it executed the command I had given 30 seconds ago. This problem exhibited itself with the volume control and other controls as well.The next week and a half were a nightmare dealing with first level Harmony (off-shore) tech support personnel who repeatedly ran me through time-consuming standard troubleshooting scripts involving resting and reprogramming the remotes - firmware updates, submitting logs to them - all with no result.Finally after multiple calls and many hours spent, I was firm in demanding that the matter be escalated to upper level support personnel. At first these upper level support people would not talk to me directly - until I became very insistent that I had no interest in speaking further to the standard support personnel. (I must say, however, that every support person I talked to - and there were many - were extremely courteous - in a uniform, scripted sort of way you might get in a nice chain restaurant.)I eventually found out that this is a firmware problem has existed for some time with Harmony touch-screen remotes. The upper-level Logitech Harmony engineers are well aware of the firmware bug that causes this problem - though the front line support personnel seem ignorant of the problem. See the following link on the Harmony support site which discusses the problem: http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Harmony-Hub-Based-Remotes/My-Harmony-Ultimate-is-very-slow-to-respond-when-i-tap-the/td-p/1243238 (Harmony was very reluctant to admit this problem existed so don't be surprised if the above link is taken down.)Just to be clear: this was NOT just a case of having gotten one defective unit. The freezing/delayed response problem was exhibited in all four of the remotes that I purchased. This is a universal firmware problem affecting this entire line of touch-screen remotes - and one which has been acknowledged to me by upper level Harmony engineers.The upper level support engineers had me submit my logs once again and told me that a firmware update was being worked on to fix the problem. They initially told me that the firmware update would be available in a couple of days. Then that estimate was extended to within a week. Two weeks later, not having received notice of the update, they finally conceded that they no longer had an estimated date for the firmware fix and they would be in contact with me when it was available.During this saga I called in to the Harmony support line countless times. The support line is answered with a recorded greeting from the head of Harmony customer experience who offers his personal email address at the end of the greeting and invites callers to email him directly if their concerns are not satisfied. I started to copy this person on my email exchanges with support engineers. Then I wrote two emails directly to him outlining my frustrations, providing incident numbers, and seeking his assistance. The response was . . . crickets. It's been almost three weeks since I first reached out to this person and still I have received no response from him. So I must conclude that the invitation to contact him directly is simply marketing B.S. Who knows, maybe he is not even a real person.Of course, I returned all four remotes before the Amazon 30 day return window expired.Seeking another alternative I found that the reviews online for the Harmony 650 remote were generally very positive. Call me a glutton for punishment after all the problems I had with the touch screen Harmony remotes - but last week I purchased two of the (much cheaper) Harmony 650 remotes to try out in my bedroom.So far (knock on wood) the Harmony 650s seem to be working out very well. They are older tech and do not have all of the bells and whistles of the touch screen remotes. But so far at least they seem actually to work! I find that I prefer them ergonomically since they have hard number buttons which are much more convenient than the touch screen remotes which you have to swipe to unlock, then swipe a second time to access the soft number buttons.If you have any components inside a cabinet you will need to utilize an IR extender kit in order to use the Harmony 650. There are several highly rated IR extender kits available on Amazon for a modest price. And the Harmony 650 won't control your Nest thermostat or Phillips Hue lights - if you have them. But you can already control these devices from your smart phone - so this is not much of a sacrifice.Because of the good experience I have had this past few days with the Harmony 650s in my bedroom, I just ordered two more Harmony 650s to replace the Ultimate Home remotes I had tried unsuccessfully to use in my family room and home gym. My family room is a closed cabinet system so I also ordered an IR Extender kit for that location.Keep in mind that I have only had the Harmony 650s for less than a week. It is possible that problems might crop up. But if I end up having problems with the Harmony 650s I pledge to update this review with that information.I seldom write reviews and have certainly never written such an extensive one. But after all of the wasted hours and frustration these remotes caused me I felt somewhat of a civic duty to warn others of the serious problems they are likely to experience with these remotes.Update to prior review as of 1/21/2015: I have received support on this issue. There is a firmware update that Logitech has given me for the Ultimate One (4.2.48), which has for the most part fixed the delayed response/freeze-up problems that I was having previously. As of the date of this update, this firmware has not yet been released for the Ultimate One, but should be available for the Ultimate Home remote. However, if you have these problems with the Ultimate One I suspect that you can get this update from tech support. It should be widely available soon. With this fix I can recommend the remote.",ByHighlando,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Don't believe the bad reviews.,"After reading the nasty reviews of this quality product, I had 2nd thoughts about the purchase. After my 1st use, I was convinced that this is not only a huge improvement over my Harmony 890, but might just be the 'perfect' universal remote. Setup was dead easy and took only a few minutes while the setup software copied the settings from my 890. The touch screen eliminates all of the ergonomic' issues that have been ballyhooed in those ugly reviews. And, I haven't even delved into the macro possibilities of the touch screen. That I will save for a quieter day. I purchased the 200 model as I do not see the need for my remote to close the drapes or turn on the lights. A nice price for an excellent product.",ByAmazon Customer,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Nice remote. Works good,"Nice remote. Works good.Things I don't like: touch screen should be at the top. The controls at the top are used a lot and it's awkward to use them.Also if the screen was up to you wouldn't need the swipe to unlock because you wouldn't accidentally touch the screen. I tried to turn it off but then I found myself accidentally touching it. They really screwed up with the touch screen location. It almost makes me want to change my review to 3 stars.When you use a macro and something doesn't turn on, you should be able to use that macro again. Instead you have to go into menu and go to device and then correct the problem. I understand why they did that but it would be easier to run the macro again.Doest allow you to control volume from multiple devices. Example. I use my recieved for volume so most of the time it isn't an issue. But I like to let the kids watch Netflix through the smart TV and it won't allow you to use the TV volume after you told it you use the receiver for volume in the setup screens.Things I like:Nice feelSlimI like the favorites in the screenUpright chargerWorks good.",BySCOTT N.,4

I found this very easy to set up. I had all new equipment so had to change the online configuration but once you've done it with prior models it is very easy to use the new version of the software. The addition of favorite channels is a nice addition. The remote feels good in the hand, it is intuitive to use and works as advertised. When my other remote went out my wife was frustrated because we had to use several remotes to operate all the equipment. Other universal remotes are more difficult to set up and use.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Great company, but subpar remote.","I love the old Harmony One 900 Remote. It is a great remote. About a year ago it could no longer hold a charge, so I got a replacement battery on Amazon. When I tried to replace it, I noticed that the stock battery was so inflated that it would not come out. I talked to Logitech tech support, and Logitech being the incredible company that it is, sent me a replacement. The problem is they no longer produce the 900, so I got this thing. I have used it for about a year. It is a fine remote if you have never used the 900, or never use the tracking buttons located at the top of the remote. If you do, as I do, and as many reviewers do, you will be annoyed with it. Proponents of this remote will tell you that you can program any button you want on the touchscreen, but not everything benefits from a touch screen interface. Remote buttons are one of those things. Especially when you don't want to take your eyes off your TV. Have you ever tried to control your A/V equipment using the IR blaster on your phone Its a similar experience.Pros:Nice ergonomic back, allows for dual handhold positions, which are required to access tracking buttons at topIR blaster works niceNew software allows easier programming- It was pretty easy before however.The charging base is ok, I prefer the 900 charging base where the remote lies flat.The battery isn't about to explode.Cons:Using it as a remote.There are touchscreen buttons to go back on the screen without a hard button return. Most users, thanks to Apple, are accustomed to a permanent go back hard button. This doesn't exist.In the end:I couldn't use it anymore. I found a tutorial online how to dismantle the 900, replaced the battery, and it works as good as new. Much better experience.",ByVasitha N. Obeyesekere,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Better Logitech remotes available for better prices,I have been a long time fan of the Harmony remotes..I cannot even remember how many different models I had purchased over the years.. I was ecstatic when the harmony smart control came out. I loved the idea with an iPhone app for more complex functions and a simple non-screen remote for the day to day usage.After a while though I found myself using the iphone app more and more.. This lead to keeping phone charged. Unlocking it to get to app. Launching app. So I thought an Ultimate remote added on to my hub would be great.It was not!The migration was easy enough but right off the bat the Ultimate would not turn my TV on and Off.. It would not control my appletv AT all. Said I had to setup the remote as a bluetooth keyboard. Did not have to do that with the other ONE remote. Even after setup it worked periodically and the bluetooth would pair and unpair and pair and unpair.The bugs and glitches took me back to the first Gen Harmony. I gave up after 2 hours.Expensive is not always better. Do yourself a favor Get the smart control with the simple remote and the iPhone apphttp://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Harmony-Control-Smartphone-Simple/dp/B00BQ5RYI4/refsr12ieUTF8qid1405979126sr8-2keywordsharmony+remoteit is much simpler and cheaper yet still gives you the iphone app so you can do more in depth changes if needed.,ByShawn,2
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Great idea poor engineering,"Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under DVD. Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out.",BySteve B,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,This updated Logitech Harmony is a great item. A lot of great features.,"I have been using Logitech items for quite a while from mice to previous remotes. I was offered the chance to review this item and my impressions are favorable.1. What's in the box You receive the remote, plus the charging cradle and a brief instruction booklet.2. Aesthetic: I have the previous Harmony One remote and in comparison this unit is smaller. It is simply much more compact. The first obvious difference is the lack of a numerical keyboard. Second, this unit is designed to sit vertically in the charger (as opposed to horizontally with the previous model). Also, the off button, and many of the buttons are quite a bit smaller. The bottom side has a nice, rough material that seems resistant to slipping.3. Use: First off, I charged the remote for a while (a couple of hours) before doing anything. Once I got the unit turned on, I was directed to add information. I must confess that because I had a previous Harmony, the process of adding information was simple. However, one positive aspect is the account for adding information (and that is adding the components of your system and needs by each activity (TV, DVD, videogame console, etc) has been moved off from a computer based server, to a cloud based server. I did need to upgrade my account to the cloud by registering, but the cloud seemed to understand my need to upgrade and simply asked for a connection through the included USB cord and transferred the information. Advantage While I have my laptop, if for some reason my laptop takes a dive, I can use another computer to upgrade my remote easily.Actual use: Once I got everything squared away, I turned on the TV with the remote and began to figure this system out. This is quite a change from the previous remote. The touchscreen in the middle is a important part of the system. There are two buttons at the top ( a star (for favorite channels (easy to set up based on TV provider and channels available) and a Home button for activities). Once the thing is on you can switch between favorite channels, activities, a number pad, and a command page by swiping around. Also, there is a swipe on the bottom for bringing up the gestures page which enables the user to pause, play and change volume (amongst other functions).Nicely, there are buttons on the remote that make the touch-screen duplicative.In many ways, this system is a huge improvement over the previous version. I was originally not able to understand the system, but after a bit of use, the ways of this remote become pretty intuitive. I love how you can easily go to things like a help function (more on that in a bit), a devices button and ways to adjust the remote on the fly without having to access the cloud to update the remote.What things didn't I like (There are only a few things that are irritating on this remote based on my use. First off, I really wish that the remote didn't have the IR outlet on the bottom as opposed to the top like the previous remote. As this seems to be line of sight, which sometimes means that I have to hold the remote upwards rather than simply pointing (for some this is probably okay, but for me this seems dorky)). UPDATE: Once I posted this review, someone thoughtfully pointed out that my supposed complaint about the IR sensor being on the bottom was incorrect and actually that button is for the remote learning function. In fact, I simply had to point the remote at the system as always. Guess what Using the remote with the remote pointed at the system worked extremely well. Gone were the second presses and the irritations that the remote would miss some function. It works and I haven't had a problem since. So this is NOT a problem at all.Another irritation is that I think this remote makes it harder to have a older person or less techy person at the home as the help button is buried in the sub-menu instead of being readily available for those not familiar with the system. Though this is not something that occurs often, it is something I think about and I think this was a bad mistake (if you have older parents coming over this will be an issues).Overall: In many ways this is a great remote. I have really come to appreciate the touch-screen and the levels of menus accessible with this remote. Although there are some irritations, I still think this is a very nice remote and well worth the purchase to make things more simplistic with the home theater (who needs 5 remotes). With that in mind, I really really like this item, but I don't love it yet based on the quibbles above. This doesn't mean that are better solutions around, because I haven't seen them.++++Update: After some extensive use and modification, I am really starting to LOVE this item. The ability to make some slight changes without having to hook this up to the computer is terrific (such as modifying icon placements, start positions and similar things, this makes life easier) as well as the overall use, which as I become more used to the functions, becomes far easier. This is a great update and I am hiving some fun with even being able to modify individual icons on the channels. Awesome! The software package makes this incredibly easy to do, unlike the previous iteration which was far tougher.",ByNarut Ujnat,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,We are a family and big fan of Harmony,"We started with Harmony 800...and our recent purchase was the Harmony One, and now we have Harmony Ultimate!If you are deciding between the Harmony One or the Ultimate: we recommend you buy the latest one, the Ultimate.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Hours of frustration,"I've owned five Harmony remotes before this one. Before now, the setup has always been a no-brainer. I just finished the setup for this remote and it took me almost three hours. After all those hours I'm still completely dissatisfied.For starters, I had a very annoying problem with the initial setup. I could set up all of the devices and the activities, but then it would take forever to sync. It would hang at about 20-30 and never get past that point. I searched through many Logitech forums and found some suggestions that seemed to kind of help, but never quite got to 100. I even tried a different PC, which was strange because instead of using the same web-based installer it made me install the MyHarmony app on my other PC (same versions of Windows 7...no idea why it wouldn't use the same installer). Sitting at that different PC I finally got the idea to swap out a different USB cable. It turned out that the cheap stock USB cable had a bad micro USB connector. My AmazonBasics USB cable worked though.After that I was able to sync reliably every time. Then I had to make quite a few more changes and sync and re-sync.Now that it's completely set up, there's still one annoyance I can't resolve. Every time I launch the Watch TV activity (the main activity that I want to use this remote for) it changes the input on my TV. Then I have to manually change the input on the TV back to the right HDMI input. If this is an intelligent remote, it should know that the last activity was Watch TV and that there's no reason to change the input. I have no clue why it tries to change the input every time, and every time it picks the wrong one.If I switch from Watch TV to Watch Movie, it will operate my DVD player correctly, but again it picks some random (and wrong!) input on the TV. It's very frustrating.Aside from these frustrations, I don't like the form factor or the layout on this Harmony remote as much as I liked my previous Harmony remotes. The LCD screen gets very dirty. It defaults to a weird home page that I don't like.I'm very frustrated. It feels like their Harmony product line has gone the wrong direction over the years. I hope they can correct their course, because I'm a long time fan of these remotes.",ByDave Edmiston,1
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Very good but not Ultimate,"Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control (915-000224)Logitech finally came up with a replacement for the supremely popular Harmony One remote. It is called the Ultimate One and it is essentially the Ultimate without the RF kit. It is exactly that because in the software there is an upgrade offer to sell you the RF puck and cables to transform this to the Ultimate. It adds the missing features like controlling devices in a cabinet and setting up smart devices, like an iPhone, to act as remotes. Its a good way to start out slow and add features if you need them. The upgrade is one hundred dollars, the same difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate One so its a reasonable way to expand it.The hand feel of the remote is good. It isnt too heavy and its smaller than the remotes that preceded it. The touch screen is larger than earlier models and there are fewer hard keys than before too. I do miss some easy to use keys over the touch screen but Im getting used to the overall use. The screen visual quality is good but because of the layout Favorite icons are smaller than before and they suffer in terms of resolution. Overall the screen is easy to see and the hard buttons are all backlit for easy seeing in the dark. The lights all go dim by a user settable timer. The afore mentioned icons can be used to set up 50 favorite channels for ONE provider. This is the biggest shortcoming for the current line-up of Harmony remotes. Previously you were able to set up multiple carriers, such as Time Warner Cable and Over The Air and have sets of icons for each one. That ended with the new software and new remotes. Tech support says they are considering a change but as of this writing, its as it is. There have been numerous updates and feature enhancements for the Ultimate remote and the U1 takes advantage of them. Among the updates was the addition of a sleep timer in the remote so you can shut off the activity you are watching while falling asleep. They also added the ability to add custom backgrounds, in addition to the included set. A good source for custom icons and soon, backgrounds is iconharmony dot com. Using these custom graphics really helps to personalize your remote.My one main nit to pick with the hardware is the choice to seal in the battery. On previous remotes Logitech had issues with the battery pack expanding and they wound up replacing many remotes. I dont think the solution to use a custom sealed in battery is a good choice. When the battery dies you will have to mail in the remote to them or a service center. Not a great solution in my opinion.You program the remote with a website app at myharmony dot com. On the forum they recently announced a new software offline solution is being rolled out. This was how it used to be and many are happy it is coming back. This is a very good but not perfect and certainly not an Ultimate remote. I do like it and have grown used to it, including using its brother The Ultimate, and I do like it. If I was designing it Id have used a much higher resolution screen and used standard rechargeable, replaceable batteries. So Im deducting one star but still recommend it for its usability with the vast amount of systems.",ByIm done with reviewing,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Everything you've ever wanted in a universal remote,"I'm not going to go to much into it, since many other reviewers have given in depth breakdowns of all this remote's features, pros, and cons. I just wanted to quickly share my experience with this remote. I'm using the remote only, with no harmony hub. First off, this remote is about as sexy as remotes can get. It feels great in the hand, and is very ergonomic, all of the buttons are easily accessible with one hand. The battery came with enough juice for me to setup and tinker right out of the box. Setup is a breeze add devices, add activities, add favorites, done in 10 minutes max. I initially had trouble with the activities. The remote was not giving my TV long enough to turn on, so it wasn't switching to the proper input. I though I was going to have to go in and tinker with the delay settings, but the remote asked me if everything went smoothly, and when I told it no, it asked me a few simple questions to determine what went wrong, and get me watching immediately. After that, I had no more issues. Based on my answers to the questions it asked me, it automatically adjusted the delays between commands, no need to hook it back up to my computer. On some of the older harmony remotes that I've used, you had to turn all of your devices off in order to start a new activity. With this remote, the TV can stay on. When I am in a watch blu ray activity, and I press watch xbox, it turns off my blu ray player, turns on my xbox, and switches the inputs on my TV, fantastic!! I can't begin to express how pleased I am with this remote. It replaced 6 big clunky remotes, and works like a charm. That being said, there are 3 features I would like to see added, and they are all things that can be added with a firmware update on Logitech's end. When switching activities, I want it to ask me if I want to power off my current device, instead of just doing it automatically. I would also like the option to have the remote display a clock when docked, that way it serves a purpose when its just sitting there on your end table. It could also serve as a digital picture frame. It could easily store a couple dozen photos, and cycle through them while docked. If those feature were added, then remote controls can be improved upon no further. If you can spare 1/4 G, buy it right now.",ByCW,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,There Can Be Only One!,"OK, I stole the review title from the infamous Highlander movie, but I did so because it does apply. The Harmony One, in world of universal remotes, really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes, but does so at a seemingly steep price, and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another Logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online Logitech profile.This is my third Logitech remote - I am upgrading from an older model, the 650. The programming software I was using to update my 650 is no longer used by Logitech, nor does it even recognize the Ultimate One. So, despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote, the remote could not connect to the Logitech website. I wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via Google that the One is not compatible with the old software. It would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructions.I was less than thrilled when I learned I would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the Logitech website with my existing information. Once I did, thankfully it asked if I had an existing account and once I entered my old information, it allowed me to port over all my existing devices. So, I got to where I needed to be but it took longer than it should have.Those of you who have Logitech remotes know that you enter your devices (TV model, DVD player, Home Theater Receiver model, etc) and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie, playing a game. etc., and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function. (e.g., which device controls sound and volume, etc.) Once this is all programmed, you update the remote (which is connected to your computer) and off you go. Once this data is entered and configured, the One really shines. It lights up when you pick it up. You can control all your devices of course with just the one remote. You can even stagger power on or off order if you want. It will set your TV and other devices to the correct inputs if they need to be changed between functions.I use an Xbox One to watch my Blu Rays and DVD's. The Xbox controller is a poor TV remote. We like subtitles on when we watch DVD's. I was able to set up a quick one button macro in the Logitech software that walks through the four button presses required on the Xbox One to enable subtitles with a single button press on the Ultimate One. The software allows a high degree of customization that I really appreciate.Of course, this programming ability is part of what drives the high cost of the product. This isn't just a remote. It is really a software driven input device with a touch screen. (I use a combination of the touch screen and my buttons depending on my mood). It lights up when you pick it up, feels good in your hands, and in a feature I really like - it has its own charging cradle. Past versions really ate up batteries. I like returning it to its charging cradle after use because I know where it is when I need it again, and it saves me the cost of replacing batteries.As others have noted, not everyone would consider spending 250 on a remote. Even if you are willing to spend the money, you still need some basic technological prowess to program and fine tune this remote to make it work for you. If you have relatives that still struggle with basic computer tasks or how to program their DVR to record their favorite shows, this is not a product for them. I have family members who could not ever hope to program this remote. It is not a complex task to do so, but for people who struggle with technology, programming this remote could be a formidable task.I have a fairly simple home theater line-up with no line of sight issues, so I can't address using this with a hub. But, if you are sick of juggling remotes on movie night, or want to upgrade an existing Logitech, the One is a great step forward.",ByA Gamer at Heart,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Don't walk away, run!","Don't buy it! Save yourself the hours of aggravation. The remote seizes control of your home theater system and it is nearly impossible to make your stereo to work without the remote. The touch screen is amazingly difficult to control. When you try to scroll through the screen you accidentally turn on your dvd player instead of turning on your stereo. Moreover, the display inexplicably changes from one day to the next. Last night, I spent hours and hours trying to get my I pod to play music on my brand new stereo. I failed repeatedly. Are you a fan of software updates Get ready, this device constantly sends itself needless software updates. It's as though this device was designed to frustrate the user instead of enhancing the home theater experience. Wow, how I wish that I never bought this remote.",ByManuel S. Campano,1

I WANTED TO BUY ANOTHER BUT THEY WERE DISCONTINUED SO I HAD TO BUY THIS HARMONY ULTIMATE ONE REMOTE. VERY DISSATISFIED!! I DO NOT LIKE THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE HARD NUMBER BUTTONS ON IT SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN. ALSO ALOT OF TIMES I PUT IT DOWN AND IT SWITCHES ACTIVITIES. WHEN I AM IN MY SMART HUB OCCASIONALLY THE REMOTE SEEMS TO FORGET WHICH ACTIVITY IT IS IN AND SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS DO NOT WORK SO I HAVE TO RESET IT BY STARTING ALL OVER.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Not as good as the old remotes, short battery life","I've used harmony remotes for probably a decade now, and I was underwhelmed by this model. Basic setup is easy enough, but it doesn't seem to reliably apply the settings to all of my devices. Usually this is a problem with the receiver, it doesn't always go to the right input. Advanced setup is no longer intuitive at all, maybe I was spoiled by the earlier remotes software, but this one is definitely more complex. The battery seems to last about a week of normal use, sometimes less, my earlier remotes would go closer to a month.On the positive side it does seem to be well constructed, and has survived a couple of drops unscathed. The LED is easy to read, and the button placement is pretty intuitive.",ByAmazon Customer,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,After only an hour with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate One -- it's a winner,"This is an initial review based on just having received my Harmony One and getting it set up. I will update it if my observations or opinions change. I acquired this through my company's award's program, otherwise I would have purchased it through Amazon. That said, it IS an expensive remote, but ... I think it is worth the price.This is my second Harmony, my first being the Harmony 700. I have been very happy with the 700, but it was getting a little long in the tooth, and I think some problems were developing. So, despite some of the negatives in reviews here, I decided to give the Ultimate One a try.First, I would like to address the ergonomics issue, specifically with regard to position of the controls for DVD/DVR/BluRay playback. I agree that for some this is a significant negative, but I think that ignores one major factor: the Harmony Ultimate One is primarily a TOUCH SCREEN DEVICE. These controls are available on the touch screen. To access the movement controls, you simply touch an up arrow button at the bottom of the screen. There, I've saved a bunch of people some heartache ... you're welcome!Further to the touch screen, there are multiple screen pages available. As with smart phones and other touch screen mobile devices, you simply swipe through the screens. Even with the default settings, you can control most, if not all device and activity functions. Naturally, after a limited time using the remote, I will probably discover some things I want to tweak or add. But that's true with any new device.One feature that was not available on my 700 (which I plan to wipe and reprogram for a setup in a different room) is the ability to download favourite channels based on your location (zip code or postal code) and provider. Whoa, that is cool -- it saves a lot of time.The next new feature not available on my 700 is that this is primarily a WiFi based remote. I wasn't sure how this would work, and whether the hub/blaster architecture would work properly for my physical entertainment centre. However, connecting to my WiFi network was flawless and the signalling to devices has worked perfectly as far as I can tell at this point.And in regard to signalling, the Ultimate One is MUCH faster than my 700. Maybe when I reprogram the 700 I can speed it up, but at this point I think the Ultimate is just plain better.The setup of the Ultimate One was quick and painless. The web-based installation gave me the option of transferring the settings from the 700 to the Ultimate, and it worked perfectly. Even without this advantage, first-time owners of a Harmony remote will find program so much easier than most other universal remotes.After getting the Ultimate set up, I downloaded the Harmony Control app for my iPond Touch, and my wife will download the app for her iPhone and iPad. My brief experience with the app is that it is cleanly designed and performs well.So my summary for initial impressions is that this is a great remote. I frankly think that a lot of negative points in reviews are overblown. I am not judging the reviewers, but think that the overall perspective of having a solidly designed, well manufactured remote that offers the performance that it does, well, my opinion is many if not of the most of the niggles are minor. Just my opinion.",ByEarl Dunbar,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,pay attention to reviews....,"While the universal remote concept is great idea, i.e. combine many remotes into ONE... its not without complications... like others here, I have tried these in the past, and there always seems to be a gotcha after you are 25 hours deep into making it work ideally... pay attention to these reviews....line of sight is a big issue, although they do sell an RF adapter, even that might always work, so be sure to buy with return policy. Harmony line is getting better overall, better web interface, instructions, etc.I do not want to repeat many of the items listed in previous reviews which I agree with...however, I will add this...before jumping in, ask yourself, what am I really gaining here If you have a lot of complex remotes, sometimes it can take u days, maybe weeks to get this Harmony to do everything the current remote does. Then, even when it does, is the Harmony as intuitive as your existing remote Is the key layout ideal for the remote you use the most A good example is Directv DVR, their remote control is laid out in a very intuitive manner, it serves ONE purpose, and performs that one task very well. To make a Universal remote equally intuitive would be nearly impossible.Where I see these universal remotes as a good fit is... .multiple remotes that u use in sequence to switch between audio, video, input and output sources. These functions can be reduced to a single button on a universal remote such as this Ult. ONE. However, as others have correctly mentioned, don't even attempt to do a project like this in an hour or two....very unrealistic expectations, u really have to be a pit bull, a gadget master, goal oriented, type of person to make these devices the more complicated tasks. Not for those with ADD or who get frustrated easily. OTOH, if you have the time and nrg, are well versed at these types of techno projects....and u desire to simplify your multiple remote controls, this might be your dream remote control.",Byfunbear,3

This remote promises great things, but fails miserably to deliver. I purchased two of these remotes, and had to return both of them because neither of them would sync with my computer. I have been a dedicated Harmony user for the past four years (see my glowing review of the Harmony 1100) and have NEVER had so much difficulty setting up a universal remote. The sync would hang without finishing, or wouldn't start up at all, and the setup failed to recognize a couple of my devices even though I was absolutely certain I had entered the correct model numbers. I am considerably tech-savvy, and could understand if this problem had occurred with only one remote... but BOTH!! Never again.",ByMichael Selk,1
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,The only remote you'll ever want.,"Having owned one of each of the last four generations of Logitech Harmony remotes, I should be immediately called out as a homer on the brand and concept, and I am. But I've had quibbles with all of them over time, and I'll go over some of those quibbles - and why they've been eliminated from the nearly perfect Harmony Ultimate One.The first quibble was size and feel. It was difficult to reach buttons on larger versions of the harmony without swinging it two-handed like a broadsword. This version is easy to manipulate, from top to bottom.The second was the touchscreen. With old Harmony remotes the odds you could get through a TV session without accidentally brushing the touchscreen and landing, inevitably, on channel 1 were next to nil. This one does an excellent job of disregarding inadvertent contact with the screen. In addition, the screen is much more useful, with swipe motions to go between the four major functions (touchpad, number pad, function screen and channel screen).The third was the setup. This is the main selling point for the Harmony, the ability to make all your devices function with one touch for an activity. Previously, this required a lot of manual finesse. One example: my receiver needs about 5 seconds after turning on to boot and receive additional commands. With the old remotes, I had to manually program in the delay. With the Ultimate One, the delay is accounted for. I can't imagine how much product testing and research by the logitech team went into the presets that accompany each device you add, but I haven't had to customize the remote's interaction with *anything.* It just works.",ByGadget Girl,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Harmony Ultimate One Review,"Harmony Ultimate One ReviewA few weeks ago I received and then responded to an E-Mail/survey from Logitech (It pays to register your products!). To make a long story short although I am not a professional reviewer, they chose to give me a Harmony Ultimate One universal remote to test and review as a customer (how cool is that). Anyway, regardless of how I got my hands on this unit, I promise an honest review, so here it goes:Ease of SetupWhen I received the Ultimate One (I'll refer to it as the U1 for the remainder of the review), I had already been familiar with the My Harmony website, where I had set up the U1's predecessor the Harmony Touch. Just like that endeavor, setting up the U1 on the website was as simple as can get. You're walked through each step beginning with finding your components on their HUGE database (I had no trouble finding all my gear), then arranging your activities (e.g. watch TV, listen to a CD, play a video game, etc.) and finally synching everything together to make it work. The bigger and more complex your system, the longer it may take you to set up the remote, but the ease of it all remains the same. Using the website to set up the remote is a trouble free and actually pleasurable experience. SCORE: 5 out of 5Ability to CustomizeThe U1 allows for some pretty cool customization. For one example, you can upload jpeg photos for icons. So, in theory, if you took a digital photo of yourself, you can use that picture as an icon to watch TV (the inner geek in me loves this stuff)! Aside from that, you can change background colors, change the name of an activity (like changing watch TV to Living Room TV), adjust the touch screen brightness, etc. One cool feature is that you can adjust the brightness of the back-lit hard buttons independent from the touch screen (nice). You can even choose how you want the unit to provide tactile vibration feedback when you press a touch screen button/icon (also a nice touch). On the down side, if you're into animated menus and icons, you won't find any here. SCORE 4.5 out of 5Performance/Ease of UseThe simplicity of the U1's setup transferred to its use. Logitech seems to get everything right off the bat. After listing my gear and arranging my activities, everything works perfectly. I don't know how they do it, but the delay times, sequence of power on/input choice, etc... was perfect. If for some reason it isn't, you can always adjust as needed. For TV viewing, Logitech Harmony provides 50 favorite channels, which show up as Icons on your U1. So, if you program HBO HD into your favorites, simply press the appropriate Icon to get that channel. The best part is, the Icon's, along with the corresponding channel numbers, are selectable from Logitech's impressive database (simple as can get). Being that this is an IR remote (with good line of sight coverage), if you accidentally move away while turning your components on, or off, causing a part of your system not to respond to IR commands, simply activate the help feature. The U1 will guide you through all of your components, ensuring that each one is on and the appropriate inputs are engaged in your display device/receiver/switcher. SCORE 5 out of 5ErgonomicsMuch has been written about the transport buttons located on top of the U1's predecessor, the Touch. They are still there on the U1, however, the fast forward and rewind buttons perform double duty: keep your finger pressed on either and you can skip/go back to the next/previous Blue Ray, DVD or CD chapter or track (I Like!). The vibrate feature (when you hit a touch screen Icon) and the auto-on based on motion, are HUGE improvements over the Touch, in my opinion. I don't know if Logitech meant for it to be handled this way, but concerning the aforementioned transport buttons on top of the remote... I find that it's easier to manipulate them with my forefinger than thumb. The backside of the remote has a more tactile friendly feel (like very light sandpaper). The front touch screen, surrounded by the hard buttons nestled onto the remote, is quite attractive. The non-contact areas finished in piano-gloss black add to the fit and finish. SCORE 4 out of 5ValueIt's hard to assign a value rating on consumer electronics. In my opinion, one must decide: Does it make my life easier Does it make my life more enjoyable If the answer to both of those questions is yes, then what's an appropriate price for such bliss At 249.99, the U1 isn't cheap however, for a home theater nut like me...its value is awesome! Would I recommend this remote for someone with just a flat panel and cable box Absolutely not! There are far less expensive options out there for that. Now, if money is absolutely no object and you asked me...I would say yes! However, I would also wonder why you don't have a more advanced, complex system. For the Home Theater enthusiast (like me...), the U1 is a very good value. After spending literally thousands (over the years) on Home Theater equipment, 249.99 is indeed a good value. SCORE 4.5 out of 5Plus and minusesPlus: Incredibly easy set up and use. Gesture capability with customization. Can control 15 devices. Comes with charger and one year warranty! Vibrate command option. Motion control backlight. Fifty channel favorites with appropriate Icons.Minus: The infamous transport buttons located above the touch screen. Price for simple systems may not be a value. You cannot replace the rechargeable battery.Final ThoughtsGet this remote! If you have components hidden away in cabinets or out of the direct line of sight for infrared, then purchase the Harmony Hub (about 100.00). I use it in my home theater and it works beautifully. However, as a standalone remote, the U1 has pretty good range for IR (as did its predecessor, the Touch). If you have more than a flat panel and a cable box, this remote should be at the top of your list. You will be able to set it up quickly and be able to use it efficiently. FINAL SCORE 4.6 out of 5",ByWilliam J. Morales,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Does what it says it will,"I bought this remote to replace an old Harmony One, and so far it has been a good replacement. It does NOT operate devices out of line of sight (there has been some confusion in earlier reviews regarding this, even though there's nothing in the description that says that it does), which is fine for me all of my devices are behind glass and this works just fine. If you need beyond-line-of-sight functionality you'll have to spring for the more expensive version with the hub.Setup was easier than my old remote, the web-based setup had a better knowledge of the actual names of the inputs and outputs on my receiver, so there was no trial and error as could happen with the older model. All told, setup took about 10 minutes most of this was waiting for a firmware update. Actual defining of activities, devices, and inputs took only a few minutes and worked the first time.All that said, the ergonomics of this remote are not as good as the old Harmony One. The lack of a hardware number pad is unfortunate but a reasonable tradeoff for the reduced size, but the real problem is the placement of the DVR controls on the top. It's annoying and forces you to move your hands too much for these commonly-used controls. Besides this, it's a nice remote and I plan to use it for a long time.",BySpalding Craft Jr.,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Exactly what I needed!,"My experience with this remote has been nothing but a joyous one. The setup on their website was not only easy, but actually fun for me. It was a four step process (add components, add activities, add your favorite channels, and one more I'm forgetting). Setting up my favorite channels took me the longest, but I'm super organized, so I was moving channels around and going through all of my channels.The customization possibilities with this remote seems endless. When there were buttons that were either missing or didn't do what I wanted, it was super easy to either add a whole new button/functionality (by simply pointing my old remote at my Harmony and teaching my Harmony the new button) or edit a current button.You can edit graphics as well, such as the background or your favorite channel icons. I also created a Sequence (basically a macro), which worked perfectly fine - my sequence was watch in 3D which, while in my Watch a Movie activity, had about 4 steps of using my TV's 3D function. I even added a delay of 3 seconds before a couple actions (such as waiting for a screen to fully display before the Exit action was selected).Customizing this remote does require SOME technical skills, but that's expected with this remote, I think. It is pricey, but for what it does and how it's already programmed for each of my components, I think I got my money's worth.If I had to nitpick, it's not as easy as it should be to connect the sync cable to the remote. And also, it'd be much nicer if it was bluetooth instead of having to connect a cable to sync.I replaced 5 remotes and it works great for all:Sharp TV: LC-80LE844UYamaha receiver: RX-V473Sony Blu-ray player: BDP-BX57DVR receiver: Motorola VIP1216Xbox 360And I'll soon be adding Xbox OneI have a Wii U, but this remote won't work with that, which is fine, because I use Xbox for media streaming.Overall, I highly recommend this remote for anyone with the same needs as me!",ByTom Reagan,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,My Sixth Harmony remote model and the first one I returned.,"I have owned Harmony remotes since long before Logitech bought out the company.I have lived with the knowledge that each remote would only last about 3 years before some form of button failure would develop, but it was worth it because no other remote on the market had the ergonomics and feature base and ease of setup of a Harmony remote.My fifth and best remote was a 900 and it was a fantastic remote until the volume and channel buttons started to fail at the young age of only 2 1/2 years.So I went out and bought a Harony Ultimate One at Best Buy and man oh man did I regret that! First of all has Harmony completely forgotten why remotes like the 1000 where failures and remotes like the 900 and the orginal Harmony One where great success stories Yes Harmony it was the BUTTONS and the right mixture of LCD that made the remote a must have. With the Ultimate you have too much LCD and not enough hard buttons. With LCD buttons you have to constantly look down at the remote when trying to do anything! With Physical buttons you can feel your way around the remote. Anyone who uses a remote for 2-3 weeks will become very use to finding most of the needed buttons without ever looking down once at the remote. With Touch screen buttons you can use it for years and you will still need to look down to see if your finger is over the right spot.Now while I am not happy towards the lessening of physical buttons and the leaning towards touch screen, I knew what I was getting into so I was willing to live with that until hopefully Harmony realized the mistake and made a more button packed remote like the 880, 900. But then acame the problems, it was like the remote had a built in Gremlin that just messed with it every so often. I dealt with lockups galore, problems with the LCD light staying on and killing the batteries and then prgogramming issues that I never had with any harmony remote before. In the end I packed up this puppy and sent her back.The real shame of all of this is that Harmony put the words Ultimate on this remote when in fact they have had so many better models over the years. Lesson for Harmony is go back to basics and give the customers what they want, not what is cheapest to build. This remote finaly crossed the line and got into the realm of low quality with too much glitz and sparkle and not enough of what once made Harmony remotes great.",ByRobbyg,2
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Very good remote, controls all my devices - Samsung TV","Very good remote, controls all my devices - Samsung TV, Benq projector, Marantz AV amp, Sky HD, and PS3 (with an infra-red dongle - if you don't have one of these, this model can't control it, and same for PS4, apparently as it requires Bluetooth), even a couple of obscure old gadgets are still supported. Even if the device is not in the database, you can still learn commands from the original remote as a last resort.I like the harmony remotes because of the Activity concept. One button can, for example, turn on the TV, receiver and Blu-Ray player and set all the inputs to the correct setting ready to watch, while turning off unused devices. The more gadgets you have, the more benefit you get from a device like this.This was an upgrade/replacement for an old model Harmony 525, and while I like this well enough, it is more complicated in use than the old model.General build quality is very good, much better than the older model, it feels sold and weighty in the hand. The rounded back makes it easy and comfortable to hold, but it wobbles around on the coffe table. The remote slides easily into the charging dock, and as the 525 used to chew through batteries, this is much better. However, the battery in the remote is not easily replaceable, so I hope it has reasonable longevity.The feel of the backlit hard buttons is very good, with a nice positive click, much better than the old dead flesh rubber buttons on the 525.The D-pad and navigation buttons are well placed and easy to use, but the main play/pause/FF/RW controls are a bit awkwardly placed, but still useable.The touch screen display provide customisable soft buttons and obviously conveys much more information than the tiny monochrome LCD on the old model, but as it is a capacitive type, like a smartphone, it is very sensitive and easy to hit the wrong soft-key. The remote beeps and vibrates when a touch screen button is used, but it's not as positive as a real button and you have to look at the remote - you can't navigate by feel.Fortunately the touch screen is used mostly for secondary functions, and the hard keys cover the typical primary controls. Number keys are only touch-screen buttons and therefore more difficult to use than real buttons, but favourite Sky channels can be shown as a colourful page of icons, which is easier than remembering the channel number. However, to be honest, if you are like me you use the Sky Guide page anyway, which only needs the direction pad to navigate. To be fair after a few weeks, I really have put away all the original remotes as I don't need them, so this device does the job.The programming software is pretty easy to use, a bit quirky in some ways, but since I was used to the old version, I found it easy enough, and the new version is an improvement. Also, unlike the old 525 model, a certain amount of customisation can be done directly on the remote without using a PC at all. You can do a basic set up in a few minutes, but you will probably need a couple of hours to set it up perfectly of you have several devices to control.",Bypunksterz626,4

This one is smaller and lighter, and gives a small vibration when a selection is made to indicate a successful selection. It stands up on the charger, which is nice because it takes less space on the table. I don't love that there are no physical number buttons on this one, however.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Up in the air about the Ultimate one...,"This one is up in the air, it seems like a good but it doesn't seem well executed. I've basically used all Harmony remotes each with very minimal issues (tweaking settings) but nothing a little programming and a sync couldn't fix. All with the exception of the Elite model, it's very tempting but the price is not premium I want to fork over if it ends up like the Ultimate One model. this is a nice remote and a bit of a conundrum in itself with other issues. The layout and ergonomics are not pleasing to hold and use, although I can use the top video controls (play, pause, rewind, FF, etc.) I rest my middle finger and index finger between the little fin on the bottom, still a klutzy feel. I've been using this for about two week, I'm working with it. I had to setup the swipe lock for the screen because my palm wrecks my entire viewing experience with just a light brush of skin to screen contact. The ability to fully customize the pages would be nice, other than changing a background picture adding and deleting favorite channel icons.The make it or break it part, when I return it will be because of the activities I set up. It's getting old when you switch between activities and one or more component either responds when it shouldn't or doesn't respond at all. My programming is right, I have or currently use at least three of the lower tier remotes. It's frustrating for over 200 dollars, a 40-50 dollar pricetag wouldn't burn me so much. This Ultimate One remote has problems pretty much all the time. Once, a message popped up and told me a sync error, it was hung up for thirty minutes. The message told me to unplug/plug the remote and restart sync, it took maybe two minutes after that. I do it now each time it gets hung up for more than ten minutes I unplug it and restart the sync, two minutes and I'm fixed for that moment. I'll use my 350's, 650 and 700 remotes because it's beginning to look like those are my only reliable options.This is a nice remote, but everything I mentioned above will cut its lifespan short in my home. I desperately would love to try the Elite model but don't want to deal with another letdown. I've heard that customer service is mostly overseas, that's lovely when you need help on a complicated, technical device. Always a pleasure. The 12 month warranty is a little scary as well, 2 days out of warranty, we can't help you. These (all) companies are consistently cheapening materials and other components, making customer service lousy so everybody will give up and go fork out more money for replacements. I'll go back to using the individual component remotes. I'm still up in the air about this remote. Again I would love the Elite model but 367 days later and it bites the dust, I would not be very happy.",Bymarcalexander,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Really nice, but also lacking.","We bought this remote to replace our Harmony 650. All in all, this is a good remote. If I could, I'd rate 3.5 stars, but I rounded up.The good: Can handle more devices/activities than the 650. The touch screen is clean and responsive, but not overly sensitive so you don't have to worry about accidently launching a command while swiping. Scrolling up/down or side/side is a breeze. It has the most commonly used hard buttons available, so you can perform many functions without needing to look at the remote. Has an internal battery and comes with a charging stand.The bad: It doesn't have a very fluid design at all, nor is it easy to grip if you're trying to use the dvr/dvd controls at the top of the remote. Not sure why they went away from a more traditional remote design, but this was really bad decision making by Logitech.The remote is also kind of slow during the power on phase of various activities. Ex: I use the Watch TV activity to power on my tv/satellite receiver/theater and the remote stays in the starting mode for a good 15-20 seconds, so you can't immediately change to the channel you want or adjust volume until the remote finishes it's cycle. And you need to keep the remote pointed at your devices until they all power on. First world problems for sure, but the 650 didn't do that.Activities don't work once they've been activated. Ex: Using the Watch TV activity to power on my devices, let's say the theater doesn't power up. With the 650, I could just hit the Watch TV button a 2nd time and it would power the theater on without powering off the tv and satellite receiver. Not the case here. You have to go to the Help screen and once it turns your receiver on, it turns everything else off. Very frustrating when this happens.Battery life isn't that great. I get about 3 days between charges. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I expected to be able to go at least a week. Good news is it only takes about 30 to fully charge.The touch screen has a swipe to unlock feature. I guess this is great if I'm worried about a stranger seeing what my favorite channels are, but it just seems kind of pointless.Most of the shortcomings for this remote are pretty minor, buy there's a lot of minor shortcomings which is what keeps me from giving a better rating. I don't hate the remote at all. Overall I'm happy with it, but it seems like Logitech tried to literally break the mold with this remote and came up short. If they made a remote that was basically the 650 but with a touch screen, they'd have the perfect remote imo.",Byjmm,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Ergonomically challenged.,"It sort of does what it's supposed to do but not very well. About a quarter of the time it doesn't turn on all the components or it turns on the wrong ones so it ends up being more of a hassle to get that one component on than to just use multiple remotes. The touch screen is too sensitive. Constantly hitting something I don't want. This sucks when I'm in the middle of a show or movie and it turns it off and starts up another component. I find I use these the most with my DVR, DVD's and CD's but they are awkward to use and I'm constantly bumping into the touch screen and I just explained why that sucks. The sensitive touch screen might not be that big of a problem if I didn't accidentally touch it all the time. The way the back of the remote is designed, these buttons are not ergonomically placed. I see that the remote that came out after this one and is now the flagship model is exactly the same but with these buttons moved below the touch screen. If this remote were set up this way, I would most likely give it 4 or even 5 stars if it would reliably turn on all the correct components all the time..",ByDavid Orlins,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Ultimate worth the extra cost over non-Ultimate version,"After owning a Logitech 550, and then the One, and neither lasting for more than a couple years, I decided to give Logitech one more chance when I bought the Smart Control model (non-Ultimate) on a Black Friday deal. My biggest complaint with both models was that after a couple short years (or less), they just did not seem to work as well - either signals became weaker, or macros got corrupted, not sure...but especially considering the cost of the One, I was not impressed with the durability.Enter the Smart Control (not Ultimate) model, which I finally ponied up for after getting so frustrated with the One, where the range seemed to deteriorate over time, which is just amazingly frustrating. The Smart Control to me, represented the pinnacle of the line to date, until I was able to review the Ultimate, which resolves pretty much every complaint I have about the non Ultimate version.Make no mistake, both are great, but the Ultimate IMO, really is worth that extra cost due primarily to the following differences:1. Ultimate adds the touch screen of course, which solves the problem of having to use a phone to fix issues (automated help when the macros don't do what is expected), but of course also gives you access to all the detailed functions missing on the simple remote included with the non-Ultimate model.2. Charging station. I really liked this about the One, and I guess due to having a screen, it's more crucial to have this than with the non-Ultimate version, which does not include a station. It's also just a good place to keep the remote so I always know where it is.3. Backlit keys. Seemingly small thing, but for me personally, this is a HUGE deal, and one of the biggest reasons I prefer the Ultimate over the non-Ultimate.4. Haptic feedback and tilt sensor. Again, small things, but both add to the advantage of the Ultimate. They are nice to have' features that really helps the Ultimate get that extra nod over the non-Ultimate.And of course, the success of both of these remotes is the Smart Hub, IMO. Even if you aren't sitting far away, or have devices in wall, or behind cabinets, this hub I think is the real key to the success over the previous models like the One and its predecessors. So nice to not have to worry about PS3 integration, not to mention the success rate of the macros working properly has increased to probably 95 (I would say about 50 for the One)Overall, the Ultimate One represents years of development and tweaking, and IMO, has resulted in an excellent remote to top the line.Can't recommend enough, if you can get past the spendy price, but I really don't see any other alternatives in the market with this kind of functionality at this price point.",ByBruceInCola,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"I upgraded from worn out Harmony 890, and this was a serious disappointment...","I put together a new entertainment system in 2012. A big jump (for me) with AV receiver, DVR, Blu Ray, Apple TV and flat screen. (Ordered from Amazon and very satisfied.) Even though I feel pretty comfortable with most tech and gadgets, I paid for Geek Squad to set everything up, and for me, this was worth it. When done, they went over the Harmony 890 remote with me, and I was great, until it stopped working. Volume button worn out (I think) so I researched and thought the upgrade would be OK, and I'd give setting it up a try.Wrong. The app that controls this had been upgraded, so that had to be done. An additional step of some silverlight software had to be installed also (why couldn't they have included that step for me) The software allows for transferring settings, which seemed great, until it didn't really include all steps. Guess I was going to learn how to set this remote up after all. But then, I realized that this unit would not work with the RF from my older 890. This is on me - I should've researched a bit more.So now, am I gonna spend more money, on an overpriced item to upgrade to their hub Nope. I will try to find a used or refurbished 890 that will work with my current RF extender and all the settings are working. The 890 does everything I want it to. It has enough flexibility to suit me, and is a huge improvement over multiple remotes.I don't upgrade my entertainment system that often. If down the road I need to update, I will find a teenager or use Geek Squad and avoid tremendous frustration. I've wasted close to 6 hours trying to get this to work, and it is clearly beyond my ability. As I look back on the reviews, many of the favorable commenters mention is some way the complexity in setting these up. I really don't think this needs to be the case. I really believe that the process could be much easier than it is. I hope your experience is better than mine - that you set it up adequately the first time, that you're able to do it easily and quickly, and that it works the way you want it to work.",Bytzargregory,1
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Have had several Harmony Remotes. This one is terrible.,Everyone in my family hates this new harmony remote. We love our Harmony One up in the kids playroom but the Ultimate is the ultimate disappointment. It is not well balanced in hand. It defaults to screens we don't want on the touch screen. It requires 2 hands since it is so out of balance that touching some of the buttons feels really wonky. Do not buy one of these. A used or refurbed Harmony One would be much better. I think the guys who designed this were too in love with their Android phones and wanted to create a similar feel but it stinks. I fail to find a way to make it start on the screen we want.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Great remote for todays tvs and electronics!,"Like many Im a long time harmony user from the one to the 900 and now ultimate, ultimate one and the smart control.Todays smart tvs have netflix and amazon prime, plex, etc built right into their interface, thats where the second execution functions by holding down a button comes in handy with out having to set up a separate activity..i.e watch tv activity normally controls tv and cable box but netflix is built into tv interface. well you can program the netflix command to appear on the screen of the remote or the red color button or what ever button you choose and then use the long press command to use for the tv controls as the short press commands will most likely control the cable box since that is what the main use for that activity will be used for... the point is that todays smart tvs/ smart boxes etc require much more functionality than the old harmony remotes were best used for.many negative reviewers dont seem to put in the time or energy into looking into the possibilities of programming options that these remotes have, its almost endlesssequence commands are back and longer sequences are possible than with the harmony one. with a lil imagination can do anything you wantcommand delays come in handy for devices with long boot up timestouch screen sensitivity can be adjusted for the accidental touchesyou can program the play/pause/rewind/ff/skipahead/skipback as secondary commands on the directional pad if you don't like the default buttons being on top of the remote as many complain aboutyou have the ability to leave certain activities on when changing other activities and will ONLY turn off when pressing the power button...i.e. play xbox 360 activity can be set to leave on if you want to take a break but not loose your spot in game to watch a tv. (i only mention this because it seems like teenagers are the ones who complain about this feature most with out researching enough).so although I understand how diehard harmony one fans may not like new remote, you have to realize that there is more potential with these remotes than before.

I wouldn't say the Ultimate is difficult to figure out, but it's not as intuitive as the One (and the One isn't very intuitive!).

Sometimes it randomly will not control the Roku. This is usually after I have watched a video on the Roku for a period of time. Then I try to pause it and nothing happens. No other remote command affects the Roku either. I have to go through the annoying process of switching to a different input, e.g. cable TV, and then back to the Roku mode. During this time the Roku video continues, so now I have to rewind a bit to get back to where I was. This is extremely frustrating, and it makes no sense because it's not like the Roku signals change at all. So why would the remote randomly stop sending them But it works fine with all my other devices.",ByDave M.,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,I love it - 90 of the time!,"Bought this remote because of other people in my family - they were unable to operate the TV with the sound system with the streaming player with the DVD player. I would get phone calls at work - what input what box HDMI which remote is for thatThis remote allows you to power on what you want and set the right inputs with one button. When it works - it's great.You can control individual devices AND you can make Activities happen. For example:Watch Netflix - turns on my TV sets it to HDMI1, Turns on the sound bar and sets it to DVD Turns on the DVD player (which also streams my Netflix).You can also go even further and have the DVD remote go right a selection, and okay so the actual Netflix app pis selected. This part is a bit more finicky because it depends at what point the DVD starts up - if it doesn't always start up at the same place it would go right a selection and okay to the wrong app. Hope that made sense!Other features:You can add an icon to the activity you createYou can individually program buttons to what you want when in a certain activity, e.g. a short press can do something on the DVD player, while a long press can do something else on the sound barWhy I'm knocking stars off:For some reason that I haven't quite figured out, things don't ALWAYS turn on when they are supposed to or inputs don't go to the right input (It goes to HDMI2 when its supposed to be HDMI1). These errors maybe happen 10 of the time - but still wish they wouldn't happen at all! Because then I'll get a phone call!Next to the favorites button and the home button - I wish there was a devices button where it would go to your options of which device you want to control. Right now you can do that, but you have to go through a not so obvious way. Which REALLy sucks when its my family members trying to figure out how to control a certain device.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Previous version was much better in hardware and software,"Previous version was much better in hardware and software. The problems I have are short battery charge life and it loses control of some features/buttons at different times which require you to turn off the activity and re-select the activity to restore functionality of commands. Firmware updates have not solved the command drop problem and there is nothing you can do about insufficient battery for the electronic issue. Also, and directly related to the battery life issues is the over-reliance on the LCD screen. I prefer a better balance between buttons and LCD screen. Buttons allow less time spent staring at the remote when you do not want to. This may be an overreach thinking that all things are better of with more/most/all of its functionality tied to a screen but a remote is not a phone or tablet/PC and the viewing source of the entertainment, it is meant to be just a control. Having to focus on the screen to command your electronics can be a pain.

As I said I programmed all the others, so I don't think I am too bad at it, but I have not been able to get this one to work consistently yet.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Terrible device - Will not buy another Logitech product.,"This is my third Logitech Harmony unit and my last. My original was quite good although developed issues. When it finally gave up the ghost I replaced it with the next version which had a touch screen and resolved the issues of the original. Unfortunately, that one was destroyed by water damage after a burst pipe. I replaced it with the Harmony Ultimate One and it is absolutely horrible. The ergonomics are horrendous, it is difficult to use some of the most common buttons without physical gyrations or using two hands. In addition, the touch screen is so sensitive that you are constantly activating things you don't want.I switched to a new provider (went from cable to satellite) and the Logitech does not fully support the new device including the fact that it won't bring up the numeric pad on the touch screen) to enter a channel. This means that I still have to resort to the satellite box remote to easily control the box.The topper is that after just a little over a year (just enough time for the warranty to run out) the Off button no longer works which now makes the remote control completely useless.Just not worth the hassle.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Total Rip Off,"What a joke. Because you can't change the way this thing insists on turning EVERY device on and off every time you change Activities it is completely worthless for my pretty simple system. My receiver takes several seconds (about 10) to come on and won't accept commands from the remote before it is booted up (which Logitech should know). So when I use the canned activity Watch TV , the receiver ends up on the wrong input every time because the Harmony is trying to change it before the receiver is ready. No problem, I think, I can add a pause in between the the power on and change input commands, right WRONG, when you go into the customize activity section, the built in functions are starred and it explicitly states that you cannot change the default actions, only add to them. Okay, maybe I can leave the receiver off of the Watch TV program... But then I can't control the volume... Okay, maybe there's a way to just tell it to use the receiver volume all the time.... Back over to the customize section.... Nope. Okay, maybe I'll create a totally custom, Watch TV but then the Favorites won't work, man that's like half the reason I bought this 250 remote... Oh and it still doesn't handle the power (the most basic function of any piece of equipment) correctly so that doesn't solve anything. Oh and by the way, the software to load the settings to the remote crashes about one in five time you you use it which bricks the remote and you have to a soft reboot (hold the off and menu keys down for 20 seconds). And so begins a cascading set of compromises that ultimately renders the Logitech Harmony One a very INCAPABLE universal remote. not even as good as one that can be ordered from this very site for about 20. I've played with this thing for a week and the only way I can make any use of it is to use the individual devices means of controlling things (like that good old 20 universal one). But becaeuse Logitech makes the cool features, like the Favorites dependent on their notion of Activities none of that works for me. Oh, and when you're looking at the touch screen for individual devices, The button descriptions take up the whole screen sooyou can only see 3 or 4 buttons at a time, making that pretty much worthless too. Well just the icons would do, maybe I can get rid of the descriptions... Back over to the customize section, you can change the label, but it can't be blank and you still only get one button per line..... You see where this is going.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Dropped from Logitech Harmony Product Line.,"Dog ate my Harmony One Advanced remote - it was a great remote!This one, the Ultimate One IR Remote, is not nearly as stable or useful as the original. The touch screen is touchy and cranky. It is VERY sensitive to the angle and pressure you use to activate functions frequently selecting channels you didn't... No matter how many times I program it - it continues to confuse the BD (BlueRay) and TV/SAT (Dish) selections - requiring either the Help button or a manual input to make the desired selection. It is slower in executing commands than the original (I hope Logitech Management reads this). However, it works (mostly) and is better than a side table full of disparate remotes.EDIT: 22 September 2014 - Still have to keep a couple of the old device-specific remotes handy. For example the Ultimate One does not mirror all controls of my Panasonic BD Player...once in a while I have to use the original remote for accessing all the settings or functions. Battery life is a joke - a couple of days off the charger and it dies. The more I use the Ultimate One the more I dislike the nameless engineer who designed this mediocre excuse for a Universal remote. I have downgraded the original 3-Stars to a more appropriate 2-Stars.EDIT: 12 December 2014 - DO NOT BUY THIS FRUSTRATING, POORLY DESIGNED GARBAGE! Thinking maybe a firmware update could help with this device's erratic stability problems I went to the Logitech site. This piece of junk is no longer even mentioned or carried on the site. The Ultimate One form-factor is non-existant. Poof! Gone away! When a manufacturer will not acknowledge one of their products then you should RUN away from purchasing it.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Fantastic remote,"I'm a long time Harmony remote user. This will be the 4th model/upgrade I've had, with the most recent being the Harmony One. My understanding is that this remote is similar to the Harmony Touch, and Identical to the remote in the Harmony Ultimate package (with the IR Hub).The big possible deal breaker here is the lack of a physical number pad. I realize that can be a deal breaker for some people, but it's an obvious change and you know what you're getting in that regard.The device itself feels very well built. I like the ergonomics, but that's a matter of opinion of course. Aside from the physical number pad, you are short a couple of physical buttons that appear on some other models, but in exchange you have the wonderful feature of being able to assign a long and short press to each physical buttons (distinguished by a nice haptic feedback), allowing you to set a great deal of commands. The other great feature compared to my previous remote, is the ability to add and remove commands, and rearrange the screen on the device itself, without having to connect to a PC. You still need to sync to a PC to change the physical buttons, but it's still a welcome addition.The tilt sensor, which wakes the device when you pick it up, is also much more sensitive and functional than my old Harmony One, which almost required a shake. A small thing, but again nice.Some complain about the media controls (play, FF, RW, etc) being at the top of the remote. I don't find it that much of an issue. Plus, the touchscreen allows you to set EXTREMELY helpful gesture commands (which again can be setup from the device itself). The options for gestures are:TapDouble TapSwipe LeftSwipe RightSwipe UpSwipe DownSwipe Left and holdSwipe Right and holdSwipe Up and holdSwipe Down and holdSo by simply assigning swipe left and right as FF and RW, and tap as Play/Pause, you have a nice alternative if the button layout bothers you. But again, I find the physical key positions are easy to get used to.Lastly, there are the usual customization features, most of which are either implemented better, or at least more easily than previous models, such as custom screen wallpapers, customer activity icons (unavailable on the Harmony one), etc..All in all, while the ergonomics and on screen number pad may be a bit unusual at first, it's a fantastic remote. Go and pick up and hold one in person at a store if possible, so you know what it feels like. But function wise, it's exactly what you'd expect if you have experience with Harmony remotes in the past.Oh, one last thing, the Battery isn't replaceable. Never a great product decision in my mind, but I had my Harmony One for almost 5 years and it still held a charge for several days without issue, so i'm not overly concerned. The battery also doesn't last quite as long as my old Harmony one, possibly due to the larger screen.. but for me that means about 2 or 3 days, instead of 5 or 6, which is not really an issue.So in summary, I've previously loved each Harmony remote I've owned more than the last. This case is a little different though. My last Harmony was definitely an incredible remote and each of my previous remotes were definite improvements over each other. However, in this case I'd say this one is less of an objective improvement, and more of a change or alternative style in remotes. There are a few extra features for sure. But just looking at the physical remotes and their core functionality, I'd say that the Harmony Ultimate remotes and the old Harmony One are equal and it would come down to preference (mostly in regards to the feel of the buttons and the ergonomics.)",ByHolmes108,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Very Nice Remote that does its job ... almost all the time.,"Performs as expected ... the vast majority of the time. Sometimes it seems to lose its programing as to a particular function. I don't know if I accidentally hit a wrong button first that threw it off or it just failed. Luckily, each time it failed, I have gone in the drop down menu and selected Fix It which presents a menu of devices. You then select the device that failed and you are provided with various possibilities as to the failure. Let's say you hit the off button and your receiver failed to shut off. You just select your receiver which is automatically listed under Fix It and then select the Power Off button. Each time the receiver shut off and was thereafter fixed until the next mishap which is acceptabely rare. Another consumer caused problem can be that when you hit off you did not aim your remote in the direction of the receiver long enough. So my Ultra High Def Vizio will shut off but my Onkyo receiver may remain on. The macro involved with all combined functions sends separate signals out to each device that had been needed for the function button that was previously used, e.g. Watch TV, Watch Smart Devices, Watch Blue Ray, Listen to FM. In any case, it allows me to keep all my other remotes in a convenient location, in case there is a failure that might require one of them, but the Harmony is the sole remote on my bed. Nice.",ByCMLevy,4

I miss not having number buttons... on the ultimate you have to swipe screen a couple of times to get to the number screen, but it's still not as easy as having buttons. My biggest complaint is the battery life. With a full charge it's fine for a day or so, indicating it has an almost full charge. I can come to work the next day and the remote is completely dead and must be recharged. The screen isn't staying on so it shouldn't be that the screen is draining the battery.

As to the plus side of this remote, it is extremely versatile. You can leave the other remotes that came with your equipment in the drawer. Now the significant downside. You need to have an eyeball in you index finger. Replacing buttons with a press on the small screen is ludicrous and frustrating. Downer 2, the thing locks up for no reason what so ever. You have to cover the IR port and press the off button and then with the IR port still covered, you press the menu button then select on the screen what you were previously doing. If you want assistance, good luck on that, I hope you understand Philippine English better than I do. Frankly it's a huge loser.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Frustrations of a former Harmony Remote Fan,"I used to be an avid fan of the Harmony Remote (I've owned several in the past), but that is no longer the case. Our Ultimate One seemed to work fine at first, and we were pleased. But over time, we've become less and less satisfied. Something changed over time, and now EVERY time we start an Activity, we need to go to the Fix it myself function because there is always one problem or another with one of the devices. Also, the response time of the devices is MUCH slower with the Harmony than when using the the remote that comes with the device. So, for example, when you press the Play/Pause button during a Fast Forward, it takes about 3 seconds to respond, which forces you to have to Rewind, which is then also delayed when you try to stop it. Usually, we just end up giving up. There is also a problem with the over-sensitive recognition of gestures, which causes things to happen when we don't want them to, and therefore must be undone. It has become a frustration to use the Harmony remote, and we frequently end up just using the remotes that came with the devices. Sort of defeats the purpose, don't you think Especially when you consider the cost of this product. We tried to re-sync the Harmony Remote to see if that would correct some of the issues we're having. At first the sync ran for hours without completing. The message on the remote said not to disconnect because it was in the middle of an update, but we finally disconnected/reconnected the remote, and the sync finally finished. But, much to our disappointment, all of the problems are still there. The only thing we can think of doing now is to delete all of our devices and activities and re-enter them. Since this is time-consuming, and should be unnecessary, it only adds to the frustration. This is not the kind of PR Logitech should want for its product.",Byscerbonski,1

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Harmony Ultimate One - Battery NOT Replaceable,"I negotiated one of these directly from Logitech as a replacement for a Harmony One that developed the swelling battery issue and became dangerous to use. At first Logitech refused to replace, but I was persistent and it paid off.My review follows:I have only had this unit for a few days, but so far I like it. It's a completely different concept than their old remotes. The software is new, and you program for your area and you service provider. So far so good.My first issue was, my zip code. About 4 years ago, the USPS, in it's infinite wisdom changed my zip code. Four years later, Logitech hasn't yet caught up. When I entered my zip code, nothing. Then, on a whim, I entered my old zip code, one that doesn't exist anymore, and bingo, it was recognized.The programming from there was tedious but pretty easy. Te remote allows you to select up to 50 of your favorite channels, and you chose them from a touch screen using icons that identify the channel and also shows the channel number. You can also arrange these icons in any order you want. The icons are small, and some are hard to read. What this means to me is, that I no longer have to use DirectTVs Channel Guide to locate the channel number, and then enter that on a keypad on the remote. I simply scroll on the touch screen until I find the channel I want and tap. The remote has made a few mistakes, but generally it's pretty good and choosing the correct channel. It does save time. There is also the option of a numeric touch screen for those instances where you want to enter a numeric number. I don't think I will be using the numeric key pad much. Also, during the programming, there was an instance where Logitech's software hadn't picked up the complete channel lineup, but there is a provision that allowed me to manually enter it, albeit with a generic icon. So far it works for me.As a final thought, as I mentioned earlier, this was a replacement for a Harmony One that had a swelled battery and had become dangerious to use because of excessive heat coming from the remote. The battery in the Harmony One is in a nacelle and once it starts to swell, it's impossible to remove, I know I tried. I also have a Harmony 880, that battery had also started to swell, but the battery is mounted in a conventional way, and it was easily changed. I guess Logitech is worried about this going forward, because the battery in the Ultimate One is NOT, that's right, is NOT replaceable. The instructions say that when the unit reached end of life Who knows when that is You dismantle (destroy) the unit and remove the battery for disposal.I don't believe this is the proper solution on an electrical item that has a list price of 250.00.",ByLowrider,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Works reasonably well--A few caveats--Support so so,"This works nicely and has enough adjustments that it can be made to replace probably any remote you have. But you have to consider several things before buying:It takes a while to set up you need patience. But you should have to set it up only once.The touch screen is small and unless your fingers are very small, it can be very clumsy to use.You have to use two hands to operate the remote for most functions.Support is willing but not very knowledgeable--put another way, it does not pass the Turing Test.The design has a variety of other quirks that will matter to some and not to others.For example, I, like a number of other folks, wrote in that the backlight for the buttons turns back on after the unit had been on the charger or a while.After a week dealing with Support, during which time I was told the problem would be fixed and I was told to reset, reboot, update firmware (which was already the latest version), create new accounts, re-setup the units from scratch, provide additional info and was given incorrect instructions on how to change settings, and then I was told that the problem was bumped up to the next higher level of Support, after all that I was told that the behavior is a nomral function, that the backlight is supposed to come on after the unit has been on the charger for a few hours.It took a week for support to figure out that the behavior was normal function What kind of management does not supply Support with with proper information or provides it with believable answers.It of course WAS NOT normal function and the programmers corrected the issue in a subsequent firmware update--but no thanks to the Support contractor--thanks go instead to the Logitech Technician that was watching the Logitech forums.If you can live with all that, and are well healed, this might be an effective way to cut down on all those remotes. You can Use the one remote in place of all the others, generally, without having to think about which settings to use. For example, if you want to watch TV The Harmony remembers which devices you have and howe they are setup/connected to each other and works accordingly.","Byh,s (s h)",4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Ugh, can't recommend","I got it as a free replacement for a Harmony One that had an exploding battery. I thought great they are standing behind their product when I accepted it, but this is horrible. It's an ergonomic disaster. It actually takes two hands AND two eyes to use because it's so badly laid out. I don't get why they created two sets of buttons separated by the touch screen. I like the bottom feel and curve of the remote, but the top edges are too sharp and the nice fit to my palm is defeated by the fact that I need to move the remote up and down so I can reach the buttons. And I have pretty long fingers. Seriously, this is so awkward I don't think I'll use it much.2/11/15 UpdateDropped to 1 star as the product has a design defect. I noticed that the remote makes a fairly loud buzz when the backlight is on. So I called Logitech and their first response was to show me how to turn the button highlight off. That did work, but then you cannot see the buttons in the dark. Clearly this was a known issue. I kept saying that I wanted the backlight to work. After a few minutes delay she told me it was a known defect that engineering was working on. She would put my name on a list for replacement when they figured it out. I asked her to keep the ticket open until I received the replacement. She said OK. I repeated this again before hanging up and she said OK again. 2 minutes after hanging up I get an email that says since I've put your name on the list I'm closing this ticket. She could have told me the truth when I had her on the phone. Sigh. Cannot recommend this remote until they figure out their design flaw. My hearing is not great and it didn't really bother me that much, but my kids don't want to use it because the noise is so annoying.9/22/2015 UpdateEventually I contacted them again about the noise and they did send me a new remote that fixed the noise problem. So I changed this back to 2 stars. The remote is functional and it looks good, but where the original One was a joy to use this is still and ergonomic disaster.",ByDIY Guy,2
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Cloud basing just ruins the user experience,"Sigh, I have an old Harmony that had some buttons which were no longer working, so I decided to by the newer model. To make a long story short, the cloud based system that they use has been revamped. It should have been a simple process to log into my old account and copy my settings from the old remote to the new one. Instead I had to create a new account and copy settings from the old account. This took me a couple of tries (my fault) and because I couldn't delete an existing remote from the system I actually had to create two new accounts to get everything set up right. Not to mention the new system is based on silverlight and crashed on my Mac the first time I tried to set up the remote.As to the remote itself, it works just like my older one. The only difference appears to be the battery life, which is much shorter than my old one. They mention that you should put the remote in the charger when you're not using it. I can see why.",ByRaymond Pfaff,3

I have owned a Harmony One for about 5 years and it has been really great. It is wearing out and so I decided to replace it with this newer remote. the controls do not seem to be as intuitive to me. It is missing a few key features, the biggest of which is the ability to skip ahead with my DVR. I can fast forward, but not skip ahead What were they thinking I also really dislike the swipe to unlock that you are constantly having to swipe to get to the controls on the screen.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"This gets the job done, but leaves me feeling disappointed.","I've been using this remote for about a year now, before that had a harmony one (which I miss, but we finally sat on it too many times and it broke)The good:I can use it to control my Apple TV, Tivo HD, Bluray player and receiver with ease. All the needed buttons seem to be there for with some left over for extra stuff. I've got the 30 sec skip forward and back programmed on the bottom buttons, as well as the Live TV button and cancel button for Tivo.You can setup your favorite channels as icons on the fly and sync them back to your computer.The help feature always seems to work for me when things mess up. The Harmony one often took several steps to correct the power if the TV went to sleep.Recharging dock is nice.It actually replaces all my other remotes.The disappointing:I miss having a hard number buttons. The screen is a poor replacement. You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The screen doesn't wake up when you move the remove like the Harmony One did. The touchscreen is too slow and doesn't feel responsive compared to a smartphone.The gestures are completely useless for controls.You have to swipe several times to get the to software keyboard.The setup software was a pain in the ass to get going. It used silver lite or some plugin in a browser. It would have been better as a native app. The software menus were confusing and some features seems exclusive when they shouldn't have been. I couldn't program a tivo button and something else. I had to get the tivo remote and program it as a custom button.The button signals are also too slow. I was able to shorten them in the software program, but only for favorite channel buttons. Turning things off from my TV mode takes 15 seconds or so, doesn't sound like much but feels like forever pointing it at the screen.While I could change speed of the favorite buttons punching in the numbers, I couldn't get it fast enough. I think the min time between presses was 200ms or something. I feel like I can punch in the numbers faster on my Tivo remote, if I wanted too. I should be able to make this faster but I couldn't in the software.Overall, if you have the money, get the Harmony remote with the hardware buttons (it cost 2X what this one does). This gets the job done, but leaves me feeling disappointed.",ByJonathon E. Roberts,3

Unfortunately I have had to replace due ...,"I am usually not one to leave a review, but for this remote I feel I have to. The only reason I am giving it one star is because I have to in order to leave a review. This is my 3rd logitech harmony remote. My first 2 were the Harmony 900, which I think is an excellent remote. Unfortunately I have had to replace due to small children breaking the touch screen. The Ultimate one remote is terrible!! They have a good idea by trying to make everything a touch screen. However, they have done away with the numbers on the remote. The only way to access them is through the touch screen. Good Luck with That!! It will at least take a person SEVERAL attempts to enter the numbers without any hick-ups (and I have a great connection). They also have an option where one can assign their favorite channels to a simple touch icon. Good luck with That!! That also takes several attempts. I understand the concept but it doesn't work. If you have a chance to buy the Harmony 900, buy it. The only positive I have has nothing to do with the remote. Logitech has upgraded the blaster, so that it connects to your wifi. It is nice to run your TV from your phone. BUT it has its issues as well. I think this would be a great remote IF it had physical numbers to push on the remote. Hope this helps.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Ultimate One - Nice Job Logitech!,"I've been using a Harmony 880 for a bunch of years. Finally the buttons to select an activity and its associated controls started becoming intermittent and it was time to find something else. I looked at the Harmony Ultimate hub and its associated controllers WiFi, but the limit of 2 IR repeaters vs. my multiple drawer layout just wouldn't work for me. I finally settled on the Ultimate One (the drawers have glass fronts).I downloaded the new MyHarmony app - I'd been using the older Java app for years, but decided to give this one a try - especially since it claimed to be able to transfer from my old heavily customized 880 - and it did! About 95 of all the customized buttons came over. I needed to re-assign the color keys at the bottom, but that was easy to do.The one glitch I had was in setting up Favorites - I failed to notice that the Favorites also automatically invokes one of your activities (which would typically be 'Watch TV'). Unfortunately, that's not the one it defaulted to. After setting up all of the Favorites, I was wondering why it kept starting 'Watch DVR' when I touched a favorite - RTFM! The unpleasant part came when I could find no way to go back and change that without removing all of the Favorites (a call to Tech Support at 6PM EDT came back with a recording that TS was closed - please call back between 9AM and 10 PM !). Anyhow, after re-doing the setup everything was fine - except the channel logos were blurry and relatively ugly.Enter www.iconharmony.com - a great site for almost every channel logo imaginable. I downloaded some 35+ logos from them (and sent the author a little contribution via PayPal for his efforts) and uploaded those icons via MyHarmony. They look a whole lot better - I don't know why Logitech/Harmony can't start with them out of the box.Similarly, the activity icons could use some help - a quick Google search turned up lots of icon sites I downloaded new icons and re-sized them to 70x70 using Photoshop, but there are a lot of apps that can resize images. You then upload them via MyHarmony.All in all, it took several hours worth of time at the computer - and that was with all of the activities and devices already defined from my 880. But at least part of that was my fault for not checking the Favorites Activity and then for wanting better-looking icons.The other thing I've noticed is that the Ultimate 1 seems to have a broader IR beam - I don't need to be quite as careful in aiming it as with the 880.As many others have commented, I also wish it had physical number buttons, but I've not found it that difficult to swipe the screen to get the number panel up. Similarly, the FF, Play/Pause buttons at the top haven't seemed to be such a nuisance as others have described - but I'm used to using 2 hands with the remote. I also found it easier to move (Menu-Edit) the Favorites icons around on-screen on the remote vs. on the app.Something that's a bit hidden away is the full device control - on the 880 you used the Devices button to bring up another screen which then gave you all of the learned device controls. On the Ultimate 1, you use the Menu-Devices to get you to a similar screen of devices, the to their detail controls.",ByAl Sorrell,5

But when it finally died I was hoping for the same or better in this remote. Wow what a disappointment. I was unsure about the lack of a physical keypad but I figured I'd try it anyway. First off the keypad is not the default screen. What Is this supposed to be used mainly with DVD and DVR players Do they think that entering channels is something that most people won't be doing It was easy to set it to the default screen but it doesn't make sense to make me go through that. Then when it is displayed it's slow to react and out of the 10 times that I tried to change to a channel that was not just a single digit 9 of those times it missed one or more of the keypresses. So instead of getting channel 1056 I got 1, 16, 105,106,... you get the idea.After about 10mins of playing with it I accepted that it just isn't a very good remote and decided to pack it up and return it. And now that the 800 series are not being made anymore I am at a loss as to what I can do to stop having to use multiple remotes.So long Harmony, it was good while it lasted but I guess nothing lasts forever.",ByMe,2

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Everyone in my family got tired of having 4-5 remotes ...,"Everyone in my family got tired of having 4-5 remotes to work our TV, DVD player, AppleTV, Sound system and a laptop.There was a lot of clutter, not to mention one or two were always disappearing. So I had a friend make a suggestion and he came up with this Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control (915-000224).First, let me say that even after using computers since their inception in the early 80's I wanted no part in even trying to set this up myself.I hired a guy who's in the wiring business of audio-video, telephones etc, and he set it up. He's a pro and eventually he did get it all working, but not before having to speak to tech support on more than one occasion. It seems there was a couple of known bugs but you never get that information on the first go round. Anyway, I can say that even the most challenged (technically) member of my family can use it. i.e. No more complaining. Now, I breeze through turning everything on and off with just one remote. I like the graphic interface and the ease of its use. I love the fact that you pick it up in a dark room and it lights up automatically so you can see the interface without having to push a button first. This is a really good product. In a sense it is a five star product, losing only one star for the set up issues.One other thing to add though, is that there are two parts to the system and, at first, I bought just the remote. I seemed to have missed the fact that you need both the IR Remote AND the Logitech 915-000238 Harmony Home Hub, so I had to buy the other part as well. Note that they are sold together as well as separately but if you buy them both in the same package, it is cheaper than buying them separately.",ByR. Rothstein,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Despite Its Name This Remote Is Definitely Not The Ultimate,"Have you ever noticed how a manufacturer can add embellishments to a beautiffuly designed product only to make the new and improved model more clumsy and and less efficient Well, that's exactly what has happened here. As an owner of the previous Harmony One (the remote without Ultimate in its name) I would have rated that model 5 stars. It sported several additional buttons to handle specific functions, and the buttons were larger, with different shapes and feel, and they were well laid out. The remote was a bit larger and heavier, but oh what a pleasure to use, whether with the built in backlighting or simply by feel. The Ultimate One by comparison has fewer buttons, thereby necessitating that some of them perform two completely different functions (a short press will perform a channel up or channel down function and a long press will move up or down one page of the on-screen channel guide. You'll be surprised and thoroughly annoyed by how many times you will perform one of those functions when you really meant to perform the other. In addition the buttons are tiny and pretty much the same size and shape, making it very easy to hit the wrong one. Case in point, the tiny mute button lives right below the Volume Down button. I'd like to have a dollar for every time my finger inadvertently hit mute when I was trying to reduce the volume of sound. I suppose the remote is called Ultimate because it is capable of responding to gestures similar to a computer tablet. The function is nice, but nowhere as efficient as a good set of buttons.The software used to set up the remote is not easy, especially for first time users. If you have previous experience with setting up and using home theater equipment as well as computers you should be able to navigate the software, though not easily. If you lack experience with that equipment you'd probably be better of having someone set up the remote for you. Having said all this, I would be remiss if I didn't say that this remote, despite its serious shortcomings is hands down better than the 3 or 4 remotes you would have to use to control a good home theater system. We can only hope that with the next Logitech model, the company will learn from its successes and failures and return to a design similar to the Harmony One.",ByStuart Koslov,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,A step down from their previous models,"Disclaimer: I bought this at Best Buy instead of ordering it though Amazon. (Not that it should matter just saying)I'm a big fan of minimalist design so I thought I would love this remote. Unfortunately, the ergonomics and button placement are terrible. The guide, volume and pager buttons are in the worst possible place - you have to reposition your hand on the remote in order to press it. These buttons are used the most when watching tv they should be where the LCD is placed (or on the LCD). The lcd itself is centrally located but rarely used and isn't as responsive as a normal lcd screen on an iphone/samsung device. Logitech need to make up their mind - buttons or no buttons.My other issue is with the setup. You have to download and install a silverlight application (why silverlight) and register an account with harmony in order to program the remote. Your entire setup data is stored on logitech servers so that anyone looking into your account can see the devices you own and are using with this remote. Why can't I just have a universal remote that doesn't send information about the items in my house to another companyI was having an issue with the backlight making a high pitched noise when it was on. I called the support line and they told me to update the firmware - when it didn't go away the guy told me they have to escalate the issue to some other department. When I got off the phone I got an email saying my issue was resolved. I took the remote back the next day. They don't seem like a very customer oriented company - after 90 days they charge you 10 dollars to make a call to the support line if you are having issues even though they offer a year warranty on the device. I don't get it.I will say I liked the xbox integration but it wasn't worth the 200 dollar price point.",ByRyan Adams,2

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Horrible ergonomics returning after a few weeks,"I'm sorry to say that I thought this remote was junk and am returning it after a few weeks of use. I know it looks tempting, I know it looks slick, it's certainly nicely packaged, but it's a horrible product.The number one thing a remote maker has to get right in my opinion is the ergonomics, feel and balance of the unit. Those of us that watch a lot of TV (for better or worse!) have this thing in our hands a lot of the time, and it needs to feel right. The Ultimate One fails immediately in this regard. The weight and balance is just off, making it awkward to use the touch screen and gestures, and the top buttons (which are actually used a lot when watching shows on DVR) feel uncomfortable and out of reach. The unit feels constantly as though it is tipping forward or back. It's hard to describe, but it just doesn't sit right. I have large hands, and my wife's hands are pretty small, but we both became very frustrated with this remote after trying to use it for a few weeks. The fuzzy material on the bottom of the unit is a bad choice too. I'm not sure whether it's trying to have a leather like feel, but it feels like I'm holding a loofah. I get it that everyone is different, but I really feel like Logitech (who really seems to be the only manufacturer making half-decent universal remotes) needs to go back to the drawing board. I just can't believe they tested this on humans before releasing it.Aside from the ergonomics, the buttons are not particularly satisfying, the touch screen is not particularly slick (I guess we are all spoilt from using iPhones / iPads), and I found more than once having to manually power on my cable box, despite having tuned the setup carefully and there being no obstructions between the remote and the device. I like the fine tuning ability that you have with Logitech's Harmony software, but it does seem unnecessarily complex sometimes. The remote update also seems to take an unnecessarily long time.I have absolutely no objection to paying 250 for a universal remote that does what it needs to do and feels good in the hand. However, this is not that remote. Not even close.Logitech, if you are listening, get a new design team. You can do better than this.We were replacing a Harmony One remote (discontinued) that became unreliable after a few years, but we decided to find a reconditioned one after sending this one back.Buyer beware.",ByPete D,1

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,good or bad,"First of all let me say I never write reviews...good or bad. This product is so poorly thought out and overpriced that I was compelled to write this. Let me start by saying that I have used harmony remotes in the past and was completely satisfied with them. I thought my old Harmony One was a fantastic unit until I stepped on it and cracked the glass. That was that. Then I bought this new Harmony One expecting another great product. Aside from the fact that it was a new model of the Harmony One, I was drawn in by the new touch screen, smaller size and new design. The old one used hard buttons. Big mistake. I allowed myself to be sucked in. So, what's wrong with it First, the touch screen is way too sensitive. It seems to be activated simply by having a finger near the screen without, not by touching it. Secondly, the actual physical buttons are placed above the touch screen, making it very easy to change the channel or the function accidentally. Third, it's infrared beam (I don't even use the IR) is very focused and frequently does not control all components for a particular function (say watch TV) in sync. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. This thing costs between 300 and 400 dollars to boot. Well, the story has a happy ending. I recently found the old model Harmony One on Amazon for a pretty penny, but I have a lot of components in my system and this remote controls them all perfectly. One final word. Do Not Buy This Product! It is junk. You would be better off giving your hard earned money to charity. There! I finally got it off my chest. Live and be well.",ByPam,1

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,I loved the One,"I never write reviews, but I felt I had to for this remote. I was the owner of a Logitech Harmony One for several years prior to purchasing this remote. I loved the One, it was reliable, easy to use, and felt nice in the hand. I have been using the Ultimate One for well a year now, and for the price this remote falls short.First was the set up. Logitech switched to a new program, so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch. I feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program. This added a good amount of time to the set up. The remote itself looks great, and is lightweight. However, it does not feel as ergonomic as the One did. It is also lacking the number buttons, which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote. You have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you want.When it comes to functionality the remote really falls short. I purchased the 100 hub to control my PS3. The remote constantly loses its pairing with the system. I am them forced to get the PS3 controller and re-register the blu tooth device all over again. It defeats the entire purpose of the remote. It is also not uncommon for the remote and HUB itself to lose their pairing. Forcing you to either restart the HUB or connect the remote to a computer and reset it.The remote also has not had the ability to connect to a PS4 until recently, and it still can not turn the system on/off. If I still need to go to the system or use my PS remote, what is the use of the universal remote The remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my One did. Making me either press the help button, go into the devices and fix it myself, or physically get up and turn a component on of off.I would have given my One five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is. For the 350 I paid when it was new (including the HUB), this is a real let down.***Update 4/29/16***Somehow this remote has become even less functional. As noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote. The icons are now completely useless. For example if I want to change to channel 44.1 I press the icon button because I do not want to scroll through 20 channels, and the on screen numbers do not work well. The first press will get me 4.1. Next 1, then 4.1, then .1, then 44. Finally I'm at a channel that I can just scroll to. Sometimes it never even gets close and I will just scroll through all the channels. I make sure to keep the remote pointed directly at the TV, and give it time between button presses but nothing works. I am changing my review to one star.",ByRichard,1

We have only had it for less than 8 months and the screen that has the numbers on it, does not appear, and the remote does not respond to many things. Also the screen never goes off like it used to, and it runs out of battery quickly and is annoying having to let it charge for minutes before it can change channels. It seeped so interesting and advanced when I first saw and used it, but now it also does not let me turn the TV on unless I hit off first (and it's already off). ALSO, I have to ALWYAS go to 'fix it myself' to change from TV to DVD, and the audio is always screwed up and never is synced to the right function, no matter how many times we have re-synced and fixed it, after 3 uses, it goes back to not functioning properly. Furthermore, the price for this pice of *garbage*, is overly priced and inflated, this remote is so bad that they should pay YOU to get it, because there is no such thing as giving them negative money, so, it would just be them giving you money to get their screw up remote.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Worth the Price, Ease of Use Depends on Personal Preference, Fully Customizable","This is a quality product -- as it should be for the price. I bought it to replace a Harmony 680 that failed after six months of use. As compared to the 680, the buttons are far better: solid rather than spongy and, on the single-function buttons, a clear clicky feel (though silent) when acturated. I understand the complaints of users who prefer buttons over touch-screen controls or find it clumsy to operate with one hand, but neither is a concern for us. In fact, touch-screen control is very similar to a smartphone my somewhat technophobic wife found it easier to learn than the button-controlled 680.I'm using the unit without the hub, since we already have an IR integrator that controls all the devices from a single sensor under our wall-mounted TV. The IR output seems very strong and, unlike the standard Time Warner remote, doesn't have to be close to and aimed directly at the sensor.The device worked properly after the basic activity setup using the Windows software downloaded from the Logitech website. However, I soon discovered that it's even better after customization. Going beyond things like setting up favorite channels is not a job for the faint-hearted some computer expertise is needed. Also, the complete user manual should be downloaded from the Logitech website before attempting a more detailed customization.Unlike the 680, I found it unnecessary to add commands for the individual devices that were omitted from the basic setup. On the other hand, the ability to fine-tune the delay and switching times for each device was a big plus. With the 680, IR output continued for a much longer time than it took to activate the devices. This was a real nuisance. If, say the TV had been set at a high volume when it was turned off, and if a low volume was needed when turning it back on, I had to wait as much as 5 seconds with the TV blaring until I could access the volume control -- not good if someone was asleep in the next room.For me the need for a charging cradle is a plus. It sits on my nightstand next to the bed, is always handy and fully charged, and doesn't disappear into the bedding, onto the floor, into a nightstand drawer, or onto some other piece of bedroom furniture where I wouldn't think of looking for it.My only uncertainty about this remote is its longevity, which I can't comment on because it's still fairly new. I've used Logitech keyboards and trackballs for many years and have always found them very reliable. After the failure of my 680 I'm just a bit nervous and hoping for a better experience with the Ultimate One.",ByDavid Becker,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Performs well when programmed, but has some problems not seen in older models","Prior to this remote, I owned a Harmony 785 which was a fantastic remote and has only been replaced by the Harmony Ultimate One as it is now getting to the point where we have simply worn it out from years of use - buttons getting hard to press, physical wear, etc.The Ultimate One has given me a couple of headaches. The most annoying problem is that often after making a change in the My Harmony app, the software very often throws an error telling me it cannot load the changes from the remote. Let me explain this - unlike older models, there are some limited changes you can make on the remote itself. In order for the software to keep these changes, it must first download them from the remote before up-loading the changes you have made in My Harmony so that they don't get lost.At this point, My Harmony just stops in its tracks and I cannot update changes. The ONLY way I have found to fix this is to perform a factory reset on the remote. This will get it to the point that I can now upload the new settings to the remote, but if I had made any changes on the remote itself, they would be lost. Fortunately for me, I don't make changes on the remote, so I get away with it. Logitech support have no solution for me other than to do what I'm doing - factory reset. This makes updating the remote a real chore that I don't look forward to.I also miss the physical buttons from the older Harmony remotes that are now only available on the touch screen (number keys, etc.) and the skip forward/back and fast forward/back keys that have been merged into one set of keys.Once programmed up, the remote actually performs as you would expect - starts up your components properly and controls everything correctly. I just find the user experience lesser than it was with the older models. Logitech seems to have taken a backward step somewhere along the way with their new remotes.",ByBill Ruys,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Logitech has completely destroyed the ONE THING that made them far and away the best remotes on the market,"For experienced Harmony Users, its OK, but just barely. If you are a new user I sure it is the beez kneez compared to what ever you used before. If you are looking for a replacement for your Harmony One+, though, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Logitech has completely destroyed the ONE THING that made them far and away the best remotes on the market. We are talking serious competitive advantage here folks.What the heck am I rambling about, you ask Its this: the ACTIVITY BASED PARADIGM. The Ultimate still has activities, sure, but it concept has been crippled beyond recognition. Specifically, on the Harmony One+ you could define 'favorite channels' which would appear on the screen so you didn't have to remember the channel number for every thing - FOR EACH ACTIVITY. If you had two 'Watch TV' activities, you would have two sets of favorites. Example: you might have a 'Watch Cable TV' activity and a 'Watch Free-to-Air' Activity - each with its own channel changing mechanism (Cable box or TV) and each with its own channel numbers of course.The Ultimate does not allow this, there is one set of 50 favorites that you can associate with one 'Watch TV' activity. If you are in some other activity and accidently press one of your favorites, it will terminate your current activity and switch to that 'Watch TV' activity. This is NOT the behaviour we have come to expect from our Harmony remote where the programming hides the complexity and the buttons, all the buttons whether software or hardware, apply properly in the context of the activity we are using.The disastrous effect of this designed functionality transforms the Harmony range from head and shoulders above all the rest of the 'Universal Remote' into an expensive, beautiful, well made but 'Ultimately' flawed run of the mill remote.",ByKeith,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Harmony remotes are going in the wrong direction,"This remote is a massive step down for the Harmony line. I've owned 5 Harmony remotes across the range and this is the worst by a long stretch. I received this remote as a courtesy replacement for my old Harmony One remote whose battery failed and leaked which I credit Logitech support for. But, that doesn't change that fact that I'd kill to have my old One back instead of this. Tech manufactures need to learn that adding a touch screen just because you can and because you can call it premium is a terrible business strategy.List of problems:1. Ergonomics - Bad button placement. The playback controls are bizarrely placed at the top of the remote, which in this DVR age, is a awful place for some very highly used buttons. The power button is very close and nearly indistinguishable from the rewind button which means about every other day I accidentally turn my system off, very frustrating. No hard page up/down buttons means you need to use the clunky gesture system.2. Touch Screen - This a low quality, unresponsive touch screen. These are common on devices where touchscreens are superfluous like thermostats and printers, but since it's a integral part of how you're expected to use this device it's a big problem. Swiping and tapping are touchy and laggy. Gestures are hit or miss. I understand why they wanted to add this since it allows them to combine the number pad, favorites list, activities, device controls and custom buttons into a single control but it makes using all these items, especially the number pad, a poor experience.3. Battery life - My 650 lasts 6-9 months on a set of batteries. My 880 would last for 2+ months on a single charge. My One would last for 4-5 weeks on a single charge. This new Ultimate One only lasts 5-7 DAYS on a single charge. It's really dismal and my device count and usage has actually decreased in the last couple years making this extra surprising, all in all a bad trend.4. Setup Software - This has always been a problem with these remotes and it's not better with this version. The software works and you only need to live with it rarely, so it's not damning, but this really should be much better. It needs a re-write from the ground up with a focus on usability and efficiency.I'm thinking that I may be abandoning the Harmony line in the not to distant future. It's a shame.",ByBen Gabrielson,2

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Advice for TiVo users,"I'm a longtime Harmony user but this is the second touchscreen remote I've used (I previously had the Harmony Touch, which is very similar). Lots of people complain about the placement of the transport buttons above the touchscreen...and I definitely feel their pain, it's a much poorer layout than the Harmony One (that prince of remotes, all hail!). If you're a TiVo user, it's a real pain in the keyster, but I think I've worked out some customizations that make it pretty usable.First, I reprogrammed the Direction Right and Direction Right buttons on the center wheel to correspond to TiVo Advance and TiVo Replay, respectively. I left the Long Press function on the buttons alone, so I can long press right or left to use the Guide. It's a compromise, but I really need the Replay and Advance features under my thumb where they belong, so this works well for me.Next, I reprogrammed the Exit button to Zoom on short press. This is a much more convenient way to expand to full screen if you're looking at the DVR guide or list. The long press will invoke TiVo Clear by default, allowing you to delete shows in your list.If you're a TiVo Bolt user (which I am), I reprogrammed the Yellow button on the right to do a sequence of Play and Select (this toggles Quick Play on and off). Quick Play is great for watching sports and longer shows at 30 faster speed with adjusted audio. It can sound a bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks, but it works well (especially for football where audio really isn't important anyway).Also for Bolt users, I reprogrammed the Green button on the far right to correspond to the D button on the new remote...this invokes Commercial Skip. As not all shows support Commercial Skip, I set up a sequence of four Advance (30-sec skip) presses for the long press on the green button...that way I can get kinda-sorta commercial skip functionality even when it's not there (also works for non-Bolt users).Using these mods, I almost never use the transport buttons on the top, which results in far less dropped remotes, inadvertent touchscreen presses, and cursing/thrown remotes. Hope this helps...",ByRoymus,4

Functionally things are as they should be and the unit is highly programmable, however, as originally stated, the remote is just to sensitive to stray keystrokes. Bad things happen when using this remote, you will be watching a live program, perhaps even on a few minute delay and any stray stroke can change the inputs from live TV to Radio or another channel, totally losing your live feed. My suggestion to anyone using this remote to watch live TV is to record EVERYTHING you want t see or you will on more than one occasion lose what you are trying to see.Also, the back button is too close to the CH/PG button. Many times I have changed the channel rather than skipping back 30 seconds, causing all the same problems as above, losing the live feed, losing time delayed feeds and losing key minutes of programming.I regret to say that I am going to sell this remote on eBay and revert back to my original Harmony 880.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"poor industrial design, awful software, absolutely horrendous customer support.","I have this remote. Have had it for 2 years. it is complete trash. Logitec can't design their way out of a paper bag.industrial design: every single thing about the physical device is poorly designed. the rounded bottom requires you to pick it up to press buttons. Just try reaching over with one finger and hitting volume down. the touch screen is at the same time: too sensitive, and non responsive, biased completely on getting it wrong every single time. the device has literally no seams with which to let you know, without looking at it, that you are engaging the touch screen.the battery lasts for a single day. a single day where most of the time... it isn't doing anything.the main battery drain... the touch screen, wakes up when trucks drive by, but not when you pick it up and wave it around.the Turn everything off button... is situated very closely, and shaped very similarly to the rewind button. More than once, this has caused in me a great desire to throw the remote through a window.the software:routinely, the device drops connections with bluetooth devices... necessitating a long and arduous process of resetting the connection... which as often as not: fails. It's wonderful to be unable to pause your movie, because the remote forgot how to talk to the PS3. there is a favorites list, which since the very first day, has refused to allow me to update it. A firmware update, very early into owning the remote, bricked it. leading to an oddessy of the worst customer experience I have ever had from any company anywhere (Logitec.) Quite frequently the remote forgets what action it is doing, this takes away all of the specific mappings, rendering the entire remote inert. You have to guess that this has occurred.pause, works approximately 1/4th of the time.sometimes just to kick your day into a higher level of frustration, the remote crashes.it NEVER turns off the PS3. even though it has been set to do so, and Logitec says that it does.and the 1 reason to avoid Logitech remotes: the latency is abominable. You have time between each button press to question if you actually pressed the button.this thing is an expensive, poorly designed paperweight.",Byeblu,1
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Remote works but the button/screen layout is horrible,"I have been a Logitech Harmony user for nearly a decade now and this is the first time I've ever been unhappy with a remote. My most recent remote had a bulging battery and wasn't holding much of a charge anymore so Logitech sent me an Ultimate One as a replacement even though it was far out of warranty. (I couldn't just replace the battery since it was bulging and stuck in the remote.) The Ultimate One remote itself works just fine once it is configured, but there are plenty of things that I still don't like about the remote.I have problems getting the MyHarmony software to work at all most of the time and I'm not really sure what I've done to get it to work the few times it has worked. It usually just sits there on the splash screen on the computer and doesn't do anything. Once I got the remote configured it works but the button layout is atrocious. Once in the software, I feel like this newer software isn't as easy to configure as the older version that I used in the past.The way the remote sits naturally in your hand, the most accessible part of the remote is the touch screen which is also the most useless part of the remote since you have to look at it to do anything. I like having the screen there when I need it, but nearly everything I use the remote for can be done via the physical buttons. The only well positioned buttons are the directional pad, ok, volume, channel, and menu. The exit button is ok too but I'd rather have something more useful in that spot like previous channel. The fast forward, play/pause, and rewind buttons are what I probably use the most with my DVR recordings and you have to hold the remote in a weird way bridging the gap over the LCD screen while making sure to not hit the LCD screen at all. The info and previous channel buttons near the very bottom are the worst positioned buttons though since they are near the very bottom of the remote and you have to be careful not to drop the remote when going for either of those buttons.I don't really miss the number pad that much like I thought I would but Logitech should have made it feel more natural to hold the remote at the very bottom by putting the battery bump right at the very bottom. They also needed to leave the LCD panel at the very top of the remote with just the power button above it and the other more used buttons all below the screen. I am going to continue using the remote since I don't want to spend the money on replacing it but you can bet on the fact that next time I need to replace my remote I will be looking at other brands if Logitech hasn't vastly improved the button layout on their remotes by that time.",ByAaron B,2
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,I loved the 700,"Just rubbish. I have bought about 10 Logitech remotes over the last years for myself and friends. I loved the 700, which I still have in my living room system and my bedroom. I was tempted by the Ultimate One for my new home cinema, installed just over a year ago (75 UHDTV, Martin Logan speakers, Pioneer Elite receiver, Oppo, Roku, Cambridge audio CD player). It looked sexy. However:-the touch screen function often scrolls badly and can cause wrong selections-the push button commands are placed stupidly-the cradle connects badly-the unit just died on me after 14 months...wont charge, and alternatively tells me low battery or fully chargedTough on me those 14 months, since the warranty, when you check it out, is only 12 months !Lousy product. I am replacing it by a 650.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,An excellent piece of consumer tech exceeded my expectations,"For reference, my set-up consists of an LG Smart TV, a DirecTV HR-200 receiver, a Sony soundbar/subwoofer, a Chromecast, Xbox 360, PS3 and a Wii U. I wanted to consolidate the various remotes into one and make it stone-simple for the kids (and me) to press a single button and have all the inputs and devices align themselves for use properly. TL/DR summary: this remote (and hub for the PS3/Wii U) does this easily, and I would recommend highly.Wanted to write a review to help anyone out there, that like me, wasn't too sure if this was going to be a good purchase or not. There are some significantly negative reviews, and some are probably genuine, based on user's actual experiences. However, there also seems to be more than a few that are based solely on a misunderstanding or misuse of the product. If I can help clear any of that up and provide another perspective, I hope I can do so.First of all, Logitech's legacy product naming conventions compared to the current Harmony line up (as of early 2016 on their website) can get confusing. The names One, Ultimate, Home and Touch can become frustrating when trying to figure out what is best for your remote control needs. Case in point: I purchased this Ultimate One IR remote, knowing full well that I'd eventually need to add a hub to provide Bluetooth control for our Wii U and PS3. I ended up ordering the hub separately, only to find later that I could have ordered this Logitech 915-000237 Harmony Ultimate Home Touch Screen Remote for 15 Home Entertainment and Automation Devices (Black) and saved some money. Again, note that according to Logitech's current website, that package is no longer offered, but if you like this remote and think you'll need or use the hub, I'd recommend this package, as best I can tell, it is the same remote but with the addition of the hub for less then the price of the two were you to buy them individually, like I did. Oh well.Second, the Harmony compatibility site is pretty excellent. Just tell it the manufacturer and model number of your equipment and it will tell you pretty much everything you need to know. What can be controlled, what can't and which Harmony products you'll need. Comprehensive database of compatible devices, to say the least.Third, much has been said of the MyHarmony desktop software. Overall, I thought it was fine. Relatively easy to use, but you can tell it's a work in progress, as it's not quite as slick and polished as the interface on the remote itself. However, while you may end up going in a couple of circles, the software does always seem to realize what changes you've made and will ultimately guide you where you need to be. It seems smart enough to realize that some users may do things in a different order based on their specific hardware, and it catches up so to speak to ensure your remote and hub if you have one, are kept in sync. I don't think you need to be an expert to use it, but I could see where some on the lower end of the techno-savvy scale might not understand or have difficulty. My overall feeling though, is that if you're considering this line of products in the first place, you'll be fine with the software.Sidebar for a bit on the Harmony Home Hub. Logitech 915-000238 Harmony Home Hub for Smartphone Control of 8 Home Entertainment and Automation Devices The Ultimate One remote is infrared only. So, if you have any devices that require control via Bluetooth like my PS3 or Wii U, you'll need this Hub if you want to control them with the remote. (You can apparently also use the smartphone app once you have the Hub, but I haven't tried that, and don't really have any intention either. Still, nice to know it's there.) You add the Hub to your profile in the MyHarmony desktop software, and there are a couple of ways to do this, either by upgrading your remote with a hub, or by setting it up as a new Harmony device, but both methods will get you there. Again, the software will realize that installing the Hub as a new device, or upgrading the remote is the same thing, and will route you through the required steps regardless of how you do it. If you buy both, set up the remote first, then add the Hub. Once set up, the remote will have for example your activity named Play PS3 and will signal the Hub to provide the Bluetooth signal to power on the PS3. Works great.Fourth, ergonomics and usability. Lot of talk about the ergos and usability of this remote. Have to say, I honestly find the negative reviews quite surprising. In use, this is one of the best pieces of consumer tech I've ever purchased. Works exactly as promised and way, way more of a pleasure to use than a number of the reviews here make it out to be. A big part of this is the operation and behavior of the screen. It's not like your smartphone's screen prone to accidental brushes and taps. It takes an appropriately deliberate touch to activate anything, and each intentional press is confirmed by a nice little haptic feedback buzz (vibration) to let you know you what you wanted was selected.Also, and why this is rarely mentioned is beyond me, but the screen defaults to a lock screen. Meaning it lights up, but won't register a touch or press until you swipe to unlock it. In use, let's say you're watching TV and the remote is just sitting there asleep. You get up to do something or want to pause or even record to your DVR using the hardware buttons. You can absolutely use those keys without inadvertently touching something on the screen, and the screen will remain locked out. There is apparently a setting where you can turn the lock screen feature off, but I'm not sure why you would want to, as it completely removes the issue of interference by your hand. And again, it's not like an errant brush of the hand will cause an unwanted key selection anyway.On top of that, the screen features a slick gestures screen that slides up from the bottom and allows you to pause, play, volume up and down, fast forward and rewind simply by sweeping your finger or tapping the screen without ever having to look down. Again, this too works exceptionally well. The gestures screen will persist too, meaning if you slide it up to activate it, then set the remote down and it goes back to sleep. as soon as you pick it up again, the gestures screen is still there. I find myself leaving that screen open most of the time, as it's truly simple and intuitive to use.A lot has been made of how un-ergonomic this remote is, and I just don't get that, at all. In use it works extremely well, and I really do not think Logitech committed any massive deign errors. Rather it seems very well thought out and super clever.The Activities, as you set them up via the desktop application just plain work. It is fun to watch everything turn on and set themselves to the correct inputs. And even if for some reason they won't, the remote will guide you through how to fix them, which, when I read about that, I didn't really understand, until I saw it in action myself. First time I went to use my Play PS3 activity, the PS3 did not power up. The remote asked if everything came on, I told it no, it asked what device didn't, I selected PS3, and it popped up a little tutorial on how to pair the Harmony Hub with the PS3. Took maybe two minutes to pair the two and then worked perfectly. Very helpful and simple.Navigating the screens is easy, and there are only a handful of them. Dedicated home, favorites, and settings keys around the screen get you back to where you want to be immediately. Spend ten minutes using it and I promise you'll have it down pat. For every Activity or mode if you will, the controls on screen and the physical buttons assume the roles of the equipment you are currently using. For example, my Watch TV activity means I'm controlling my DirecTV receiver and the volume through my Sony amp. Therefore, the actions available on the screen and the physical buttons assume those roles. (By the way, I find the hardware keys absolutely perfect for controlling the DirecTV receiver.) Likewise, I can choose my Watch SmartTV activity, and it will bring up the apps on my TV and let me select whatever app I want with the physical keys, while the touchscreen displays my SmartTV control selections. Same with PS3, Wii, Xbox, etc. As you cycle through your modes, the remote seamlessly offers you the appropriate control options. Pretty cool indeed.Fifth, I'm not sure why battery life is such a concern. It comes with a charging cradle, seems like a no-brainer to me that when you're not using the remote, just pop it in the cradle, no Assuming most of us have to work and kids- if you have them- are in school, there has to be at least some portion of your day where you can let the remote charge up, right When you're sleeping maybe Just doesn't seem like this should be much of a concern. Longer term, I hope the non-removable battery lasts a good long while, but I'm not too worried about it.Finally, I've been more than pleasantly surprised by how well this works. Granted, I'm a smart remote neophyte, and as with any review take this review with a grain or two of salt, but I really and truly found this to be an exceptional product plus a fun grown up toy to boot. Unless you have equipment that really cannot be controlled by the Harmony products, I can't think of any major reason why I wouldn't recommend this. It's not inexpensive per se, especially if you need the Hub as well, but for as well as it works and the capability it offers, I think it's a good value.",Bywesmantooth,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Good but compared to older models, it is annoying","This is my 3rd Harmony remote, I bought it because my last Harmony One had a broken display after using it for 4 years. Therefore my review is based on the comparison of the last 2 remotes I used.First thing I noticed is that this remote is lighter than the other ones. Also, in order to upload the configuration I needed to download the new MyHarmony software, instead the older software. The good thing is that I was able to migrate all the configuration from my Harmony One. However, after the migration, not all configuration was perfectly in place, for example, some of the buttons were not working, or not there anymore, so I needed to manually configure them again (not perfect).This remote is based on its touchscreen display, I am trying to get used to it, since my Harmony One had more 'analog' buttons. This one of the disavantages (I think): I was used to feel the buttons and never look at them when I needed to press anything. With this remote I need to look at the display every time I need to change channels. However you can include your favorite channels as your main screen, which makes sense since I noticed I usually watch a half dozen channels.If you are a newbie with a Harmony remote you may find some difficulties with programming, but since I have already owned a previous model, I think it is a very good remote, but a little worse than older models.",Byhrmatsui,4

I have two different computers: one Windows, and the other a Mac. Both have the compatible operating systems with which to set up this remote. Unfortunately even after spending well over an hour with a Logitech support person I was unable to get into the set up page. on either computer. The Logitech web site is ambiguous and extremely un-user friendly. I'm good with computers and have never had an issue with any other device, but this one is simply poorly designed, with poor software, and even though the support person was trying, they simply had no clue either. Save your money, and buy a non Logitech universal remote, and will save the unbelievable headaches of this compete waste of money.",ByMark Symns,1

Commands are left out that are critical.My DVR needs the colored buttons, which are NOT programmed by Harmony. Good luck figuring out how to keep the program and add new buttons to be learned. The colored buttons are in the WRONG order and almost every service uses the same configuration.The design by having the sensitive touch screen in the middle of buttons may be the absolute worst engineering design by Logitech ever.The harmony software aborts and will not install properly on my Win 10 machine. I have to run it from the userapps folder after a failed install.The backlight for volume and channel is the label...in the dark the arrow pads you actually press are invisible in the dark. BAD.Finally, the Favorites area of the device itself has ONLY what appear to be channels that are advertisement/paid for. You must manipulate this in the on line software...unfortunately for my provider, COX, only about half the channels are in their database.This remote is a disaster.Ray Super Remote is far better at all these issues. It does take some getting used to (no buttons only touch screen)",ByTelstar,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Nice, modern design","The remote feels good my hand. Good thing that it can be programmed for a bunch of station presets, because to get to the manual number input screen is about 3 screens deep. The lack of a permanent number pad contributes to a very contemporary appearance. But, if you find that you forgot to program one of your favs, you may end up like me, searching for the component remote to access my channel number and put off programming the Ultimate until a later time.Fortunately, when I do get time to do the programming, it is super easy with the Harmony on-line tool.",rossberg01,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Poor design,"The bad: It's a two handed remote. By that I mean that you have to hold it in your hand to use it. You can't just leave it on the end table or other surface and reach over and push a button on it because the bottom is rounded. Another design flub is that the transport keys are located above the touch screen ! If you want to push play, rewind, pause etc., and you brush your hand across the touch screen before it times out you'll change the channel, or something else. Very irritating!!The good: It's very easy to program, and the charging cradle it a winner !",lauve2005,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Mixed results. Generally good, but some fine points are aggravating","In general it works well, however the touch screen doesn't seem to be especially reliable. Sometimes it works well, and some times it takes several tries to activate the function on the screen. i also cannot get the forward/backward skip commands to work with the 'hard' keys. i get fast foward/fast reverse only. Skip does work properly from the touch screen. There is a number pad available, but it isn't all that easy to get too. It's generally faster to go the nearest favorite and use the channel up/down keys if the channel you want isn't one of the 50 favorites. The non-touch Harmony 650 has dedicated keys for most functions, and that makes it easier to use since you don't have to search through the touch screen menu's and it has the number pad as dedicated keys.",mattheww50,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Lots of great functions but a couple of the flaws drag the review way down,"The fact that you can drill down to any function of a device's remote is fantastic. There are a couple of actions I wish I could program the remote to engage in which don't seem to be possible. For example, to play a movie, I generally play it through my smart TV. If you have any movies on external drives, you can't program an activity because the remote REQUIRES a second device to be the player. That's just a minor thing.There are 2 significant problems that I have encountered.1) All you have to do is brush your hand lightly (accidentally) across the screen... the next thing you know, all sorts of other activities/functions are engaged and you have to reset everything back to where you were.2) The device sometimes forgets what you are doing and reactivates in the home mode. So, if I think I'm going to hit pause on the movie I'm watching, forget it. This happens about 25 of the time. Then I have to worm my way down through the different functions on the remote to get back to where I use the remote for watching movies.One other small problem... when entering passwords and the like, the toggle switch (up/down/left/right) sometimes gets sticky and jumps over 2-5 increments on the selection.It's a VERY powerful remote, I'd rather have it than not have it, and I like it better than my 650 (which lasted almost 10 years). I'd give the 650 a higher rating, however, in its own class... because it does everything it's supposed to and does it perfectly. The Ultimate One has more functions, is more advanced and has better ergonomics (minus the hand brushing against the screen issue), but it has quirks which are definitely noticeable.Read full review...",mrtwyst,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,In Harmony with my remote,"The Harmony Ultimate One is a great universal remote. It will eliminate the need for all the remotes you currently have, even for products that are 20 years old. The programing isn't too complex, but it will take some getting use to. Some TVs that you use for local, over-the-air (don't use cable or satellite), won't be able to work with the touch screen Favorites, due to the subchannel system. The remote touchscreen is great feature. With less buttons to wear out, it should last for years. The buttons it does have are backlit, so it is good to use in the dark. It is also rechargeable (comes with a base for recharging). So it will save on batteries.",erik3266,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Best Remote Available,"I am an AV professional. I always disliked Harmony remotes in the days when you had to answer dozens of questions on the internet to get it programmed and you couldn't make any fine adjustments. I finally decided to replace my 'go to' URC remotes with a Harmony after getting an Amazon Echo Dot. I read that you could voice command the Harmony through the Echo. I started with the Smart Home Control (Hub + Companion remote) in my bedroom. Programming was easy, adjustments could be made to tweak the settings and the Alexa interface was cool. Then I added this Ultimate One to the package because it was a better interface for my wife (touchscreen, backlit buttons, favorite channels, etc). Now she has the Ultimate on her side, I have the Companion on my side and we both have Alexa. Added the Ultimate Home package (Hub + Ultimate) to my Living Room with another Echo, of course. Also added a couple of TP-Link Smart Plugs for Alexa controlled lamps in each room. My wife loves it and I couldn't be happier. Harmony has come a long way.

However, I'm the only one who uses it, it has more satisfying feel in hand and vibration feedback on screen button hits, but needs a partner hub to do IR/Bluetooth/RF combined. And the layout of the buttons is far worse than the ""free"" basic remote they throw in with the hub. Also only the screen is backlit so I still need to memorize key positions.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,nice tv remote (but - it better be),"I had my old Logitech Harmony remote 9.5 years. The buttons (non touch screen) started to give out. I bought this new model recently. I still have my same thoughts from last time. Doesn't seem like they care about ergonomics at all. The most commonly used buttons are at the bottom making them hard to use. It is even harder to use the pure touch screen buttons (as opposed to a touch screen for instructions while hitting an actual button out to the side of it). To only be able to page up/down with the pure touch screen is almost impossible. To touch the correct choice while holding the remote out in front of you is quite the feat. To only be able to hit numbers on a pure touch screen to key in a specific channel is even harder. Again, it is the ""usability"" not the performance that lacks",zilla,2

I even got one of the tech-support to admit they knew there was a firmware issue with their touchscreen remotes. Maybe he'll fix that with the next firmware.",Thorn,3

I think the design could have been a little more ergonomic as far as fit and feel. The hard keys that control the most accessed functions are poorly located virtually eliminating one handed operation. However, it works well and a well lit keyboard and touch display makes it fairly easy to operate. The big negative is the Li-ion batteries are not user replaceable which pretty much guarantees you will be in the market for a new one in a few years. A little pricey for a disposable. It's a shame because I really like the fact that this product works well and effectively eliminates a table full of remotes.

Touch screen and customizable settings for nearly all devices. What doesn't work is remote control shades. Now the reason for two stars, the setting up of this remote if you get the smart hub and the smart keyboard is nothing short of a five to six hour event. Logitech support is terrible and you need a lot of patience and time to set this up if you have multiple devices. I have two receivers, bluray, Mac mini, Wii, Luton light wall control, cable box, and TV, so a lot of stuff but nothing really extensive. Once you eventually get it set up, NEVER change anything, because it is basically like starting over with Logitech to set it up. So great idea but bad execution.

Cons: One issue it is very sensitive, can be fat fingered easily which is frustrating some times. You need to learn to be accurate and move quickly, do not pause on the buttons. Another issue comes from the battery which you can't top off the charge nightly must let it run down over a number of days so it doesn't get a short memory.

It was the worst product I've purchased in a long time. Easy to set up but the functionality on a daily basis is horrible. Everything effects how it controls the tv components. Do you have the curtains open? The sound system doesn't come on. Do you not hold the remote directly pointing at the components for just the right amount of time for the IR signal to hit everything? The tv does not come on. Are you tired after watching a moving and click the off button a little too fast? The cable box doesn't turn off. It was always something. In the end, you spend $260+ and you still have all the other remotes sitting on the coffee table so you can grab it after you get tired of things not working. yes, there is a troubleshoot button on the Logitech remote. I think I used the troubleshooting button more then I used the other aspects of the remote. So right now I'm happy with the standard Brighthouse remote with a few IR repeaters.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Not worth the money,"I purchased this remote several months ago because I received an email from Logitech offering a $100 trade in on your old remote when you purchase this remote. I starting having problems very soon after setting it up. At first it worked fine but then it wouldn't turn my TV on or off, even if I hit the help button. Worked with customer service and it started working again, briefly. It's been problematic ever since. There's frequently a delay when entering a command. There are several buttons that are dual purpose and really annoying as you have to press and hold the button to get what you want. The power off button is extremely close to the rewind/replay button(and the buttons are small) and several times I have turned off my system instead of rewinding. My remote has frozen on me many times. On one occasion I started fast forwarding through a commercial break and when I went to hit play none of the buttons would do anything. I had to grab my iPhone and pull up the app to control my system till the remote decided it was ready to function again. Of course in the mean time my DVR has gone 20 mins past where I wanted to resume watching. The battery indicator is horrible. It has 4 levels: Full, 2/3, 1/3(or as I call it-almost dead) and dead. I've had it show 2/3 full at bed time and when I wake up the next morning it's almost dead.So, what have we learned from my experience? Logitech makes great products, this just ain't one of them!",Danno820,1

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"It's OK, but the old Harmony One is much better","I bought this as a replacement for an older Logitech Harmony One. It's a step backwards in many respects compared to the Harmony One. It doesn't have a physical keypad which makes using it as a replacement for your cable/DVR remote awkward if you just want to punch in channels. There is a touch keypad screen available, but it is really awkward to use compared to a physical keypad. From an ergonomic perspective this is about as bad as it can get. It is awkwardly balanced and very thin at the end of the device. The FWD and REV buttons are located on the end of the remote and are really not positioned in a logical place. The battery life isn't nearly as good as the Harmony One either as it needs a recharge within about 3-4 days even if it hasn't been used very often within that time frame. The ability to use gestures on the touch screen seems like a unique idea, but in practice it doesn't work smoothly. Overall it's an OK device and fairly well built, but for the money there are a lot of shortcomings.",deanjenn,3

I love the touch screen that not only shows a list of my favorite channels but also has an onscreen volume, mute, rewind, ff, pause and so much more.. The only thing I don't like is unless you bookmark the link to the setup screen, it's nearly impossible to find again..",Cathie,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Best remote in this price range,"This is the fourth home theater setup I have configured this remote easily controls what most people want to do. After getting used to a single more pricy remote to control a theater with 9 devices and being able to turn on and off with 1 button push you never want to go back to the individual remotes. My last setup included a smart TV, Receiver, sound bar, Blu-ray player and media player. This much flexibility can drive most people crazy. With this remote I was able to setup one touch screen button activities to Watch TV, Watch Media Player, Play DVD/Blu-ray discs, Stream Netflix and Play My Music and turn off also with one touch. This remote lets you log and load all the commands for you devices from Harmonys extensive library and setup activities to use them in logical sequence. The only difficulty you may find is that some sound bars have complicated interfaces to smart TV's. Some older components have on/off controls that toggle with repeated pushes rather than having a code for each. This remote transitions smoothly if you want to change activity and when done one push off. While it seems a little pricey it will save you a ton of frustration. Top Marks for the Ultimate One Touch.",TechGuy,5

I then bought this product thinking it was the best, and may be, and I felt I could control all the devices with this one product and I suspect I could have. I feel I am pretty astute with electronics, but I couldn't make this work. If you buy this, do it when you buy your new TV and accessory equipment and have the installer set it up. It requires to be be set up on a computer. I realized that even if it worked to my satisfaction, the understanding of how the remote worked would have been over the head of my wife, who may be computer savvy doesn't really want to be any more savvy than she is right now.

Had to replace the remote for my Smart TV. Only down side is that it's not very easy to control just a single component. The Harmony remotes have these new ""Activity"" Buttons which turn on groups of components and sets them to specific settings for what you want to do. This is pretty nice, except if it doesn't go as it's supposed to. Then you are fumbling through the remote to turn on or set up what ever was missed.I would have preferred to just have one that you select what you want to control and that's it.",Scotty,4

With this intuitive product storing individual remotes at hand becomes much less necessary. I have a fairly complicated 4K system with big speakers and all the usual components and only limited tech knowledge myself so I definitely needed the Geek Squad to program it. This is my second one and it's even better than the first that I got with the system just over 2 years ago. Only a 2 year warranty was offered with the first and it gave out just after 2 years so I had to pay for the whole thing plus the installation. I think someone knew something that I didn't when they only offered 2 years. This is my only complaint.,jerbo,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,A couple of MAJOR short comings.,"I loved that the Harmony allowed me to setup activities that would make it easy to make sure the right device was on and the right sound/video sources were selected. Most of the time it worked seamlessly and it was easy to go in and change or update settings. What I did not like about the Harmony was the antiquated computer application (for as much money as Logitech has made they can afford to do a much better job), I dreaded the finish on the back of the remotes -- it feels literally like nails on a chalkboard and my Harmony' all emit a high-pitched squealing noise when the displays are turned on. It's not loud per say, but the fact that it's so high-pitched it is very noticeable and annoying considering the proximity you'd have to have the remote from your body to use it (and it's there anytime the display is on). It's also worth noting that the battery life on these is terrible (in most cases it can't go more than two days off the charging base). For the ease of setup, use and functionality, I'd recommend it to someone looking to simplify their home theater setup and get rid of the 3-4+ remotes the average person has.

I think the thing that really bothers me is that the battery inside the remote is not changeable. It sits on a charging cradle, but you cant replace the battery to the remote like the older one. So I guess at that point you would toss it out? And the Geek Squad said dont leave it in the charging cradle since that will eat up the battery life. Leave it off till the battery gets really really low then put it back on the charger. Well, great, I always leave mine in the cradle when not in use. So I am going to go back and see what other options i have and go from there. Either way some of the buttons do not work - they are supposed to.

I mean, how lazy must you be not to be able to use the remotes that came with your devices -- right? That was until I was hunting for my missing Roku remote and, in the process, discovered that I had 13 remotes in my 2-bedroom apartment. Between the streaming device remotes, the TVs, the gaming stations, the blu-ray player and soundbar, my coffee tables and night stand were cluttered with remotes. That's the time that I started thinking -- just thinking -- about a universal remote. When I saw that Logitech's One remote was for sale (for 50% off) I decided to jump on the opportunity. I was intimidated at first, but Logitech's software was SO EASY to use. I simply entered the model numbers of my devices and Logitech worked through the rest of the programming and automatically worked out the combo functions like turning on the TV and soundbar, changing the TV input and turning on the gaming console when I want to play Xbox.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Excellent all-in-one remote,"I have been a fan of Logitech Harmony remotes for a while. Our old ""One"" was starting to fail after several years so I looked into a new one. This is much more compact, the touch screen is easy, and even the set up is easier online. The only ""negative"" is that it needs to have the battery recharged pretty often even though it's not really doing anything. Easy enough if you always keep it in the charging cradle (which is also pretty slick). Thus the 4 instead of 5 stars.Highly recommend!!!",JediJay3862,4

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Reasonable universal remote for the price,"I bought this remote to replace an BluLink PS3 remote that I had used for years with my home entertainment system. The major components are a 1080p Samsung HDTV, Yamaha Receiver and speakers, Comcast Xfinity X1 DVR Box and PS3 for streaming Netflix, MLB, and playing Blu Rays. The BluLink was designed specifically for the PS3 and pre-programmed. It could control up to 5 other devices. It had worked fine for about 5 years (but it couldn't control the DVR) and then started to hang up on the device functions whenever you turned it on. I ordered a new BluLink and it quickly developed the same issue (not sure why). I've been using the Ultimate One for about a month now and it works pretty well. It's not extremely easy to program, but the MyHarmony software is pretty straight forward, so it's easy enough to figure out. There are a couple weak points. It takes a while to load new setup configurations when you update to add an activity, add a device or change the favorite channel settings. The first time I had to stop the process and restart it, but then it has worked the couple times I've tried since without a problem. The only other complaint is that it takes a while to run through the macros it uses to execute ""Activities"" (starting and configuring multiple devices to watch TV or Netflix, etc. and even takes a while to change to favorite pre-programmed channels. . .you can see it run through the sequence of keying the channel number in and then hitting enter). You have to keep it aimed at the devices for the duration of this process or everything won't wind up working (something won't turn on, you'll get the wrong channel, etc). It is ""one-button"" control, but it's far from instantaneous. Also, If you plan to use it with a PS3 (or I assume PS4, XBOX, etc), it isn't directly compatible. You need to buy an additional adapter switch from Logitech that talks to the console. The PS3 adapter was no longer available buy the time I bought this remote, but I was able to find a refurbished one on Amazon for about $60. Other than that it works as advertised and is a reasonable solution for anyone looking to control 5-15 devices with a good amount of flexibility, as long as you are tech-savvy enough to navigate the setup.",PatG2,4

Controller is great, design, comfort and what it does. Replaces all controllers and executes an activity with one touch. Like playing your game console, changes all inputs, turns off others not needed. If you turn off the ""swipe to unlock"" you may find yourself touching the screen, executing an activity by accident. I had to turn mine on again after this kept happening. The charging station is really nice and looks impressive. Battery life undocked is only 4 days, so just dock it when you can overnight.

I only have two complaints.. I wish the number screen was next to the favorites as it takes more time to toggle between both. Also when you choose the numbers, there seems to be a bit of a delay that can mess you up when you want to put a channel number in fast. Otherwise a great remote that I am very happy with!",RaptorJeff,5

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Effective replacement,"As universal remotes go, this one is relatively effective and easy to use. Like a lot of universal remotes, getting to certain equipment specific features to do any AV equipment ""tinkering"" can be a little cumbersome. But at least it's possible using the universal remotes extensive digital menus without having to grab the original OEM remotes. For normal everyday use, it's quite convenient for setups that might include the combination of an AV receiver, cable/satellite box, streaming box, Blu-ray, TV or more. No need to have multiple remotes laying around to control primary functions of the peripherals. And for the most part, I rarely have to dig out one of the equipment specific remotes. But I'd probably keep them available (maybe in a drawer or cabinet nearby) if you like to tinker often with equipment specific settings, although it's not absolutely necessary. With a little patience scrolling through the remote digital menu, you'll find just about any function the OEM remotes can perform, and sometimes even more.",shinpan,4

The problem with this setup for me though, was it did not have the IR built into the remote, which I needed for my TV (too far away from hub or IR blasters). I ended up purchasing this remote, which is much more deluxe, but I personally like having the numerical buttons available at all times and find that whatever is on the screen is not what I want on the screen. I'm sure I'll get it all setup the way I wanted, but so far, my wife has had issues using it.

One or two little things are annoying, like switching between activities. Often it does not quite do what it is suppose to do. I end up turning everything off and restarting from the activity I want, or going into each component and making the adjustment required.

I have the Sonos Playbar and it works amazing. I did have to call customer service for some added help in making sure every device like my Roku 4 was identified with the correct input. Took about 10 minutes on the phone. Works great. I also like the icon's on it showing the different television stations.

We were interested in only having one remote for our TV, DIRECTV box, Samsung soundbar & PlayStation. I was out of town, so we had Geek Squad set everything up, then show my wife (whom was home), how it all works. Geek Squad set it up, and was explaining how everything works. He told her that this unit will not work with our PlayStation3, and we would have to buy another ""box"" to make it work. This is where the rub comes in. Best Buy salesmen knew, or should have known, that the popular PlayStation3 would not work with this ""Universal"" remote. Second, and this is far worse, the Best Buy salesman also knew that the Samsung 8500 that we were buying at the same time COMES with a universal remote! Never even mentioned that!!!Third, Geek Squad setup the remote, but didn't even bother to explain, nor even leave any information about how to further program the remote, for issues like ""favorite channels"", adding or deleting any equipment, etc.I find these things very disappointing!Back to the unit itself;Ergonomically it's terrible! Worst I've ever held. It is totally unbalanced. Kind of like holding a pear that's been cut in half lengthwise. The controls for pause, play etc are at the top, so you have to try and balance the awkward unit while reaching those buttons, all while trying not to let this expensive, unbalanced remotes roll out of your hand!No, I certainly would not recommend this universal remote to anyone!",Dusty,1

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Not as advertised,"To start, I take partial responsibility for purchasing an item that may not be the most suited for my needs. That said, logitech makes it a nightmare to sort between the different harmony options available. Only now do I know that there is a better option available. This remote is RF and will not work well with closed cabinet set ups. Spend the extra bucks and get the wifi enabled remote. In addition to that, the battery life isn't great, so if you have your tv set up in a room with a poor configuration for a plugged-in remote cradle to inconspicuously be available at all times, then look elsewhere. Programming the remote is not nearly as simple as I was lead to believe by the guy I spoke with in Best Buy. The fast-forward and rewind are a little finicky and do not always work, and they are not placed in the most accessible location at the very top of the remote.The pros for this model are that it is relatively easy to use once all of your devices are programmed (no easy feat).

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Not as good as their wireless remotes,"The problem with programmable remotes with IR is you they are only as good as the operator. When using the activity buttons, it can take 10-15 seconds to send all the commands out it needs to. If you don't have the remote pointing in the right direction the whole time then something is not going to turn or switch to the correct input. Not many people like to sit and wait for 15 seconds for anything anymore. Their Companion remote is cheaper and doesn't use IR right from the remote. All that means is when you hit the activity button, it doesn't matter what you do with the remote. The Companion talks to the hub and the hub does all the work. Smarter and more reliable, in my opinion.",DblJBird,3

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Great Concept - Poor Execution,"The Logitech Harmony Ultimate One remote started out as a great product with easy on line programming. Controls all my devices, even older model equipment such as a CD changer. There are several serious drawbacks. First, the remote is rechargeable and that's great if you have an outlet to plug into at your favorite chair, otherwise, the battery dies without warning. It at least should have a low battery alert that gets your attention. There are times it seems to loose functionality while it still looks active, apparently when losing the charge. Doesn't turn on all the devices, (and won't repeat a command, see below). Secondly, it is awkward to impossible to use with one hand. The touchscreen must be reached across for some controls and can be touched inadvertently. The remote has an odd shape and is not comfortable. Third, if you use the remote to turn something on, it will not repeat the same command without first choosing another command. If for any reason the device changes conditions, such as the input source, from the condition the remote left it in, you must turn it all off, or choose another command before you can reuse the first. You may think it is ""locked up"". Even though the touchscreen can be inadvertently touched causing an unwanted command, choosing by touching is not that easy, especially numbers. It has a vibration feedback that takes some getting used to but you better learn to use it or you will have many missed touch commands. Lastly, it does not play well with a ""DirectvReady"" TV when operated using that feature. Using Logitech instructions, you can get some functionality, but plan on a slow process of training individual buttons to individual commands. Considering the awkwardness of the remote, it soon became not worth the trouble. Logitech's technical support was useless in helping understand or resolve the problems. If you are technically savvy, you can probably do it yourself, but the original remote will be nearby in my experience. Even when trained, the time it takes for the TV to show a picture when choosing to ""Watch TV"" with the ""DirectvReady"" as the input, is painfully slow while the TV searches for a Genie etc.Also, the complexity of a smart tv with all the menu options makes using the remote more trouble than it is worth. So, it's great for having replaced several remotes and simplifying commands such as turning on and controlling a CD changer and surround sound system. But the functionality and usability for a smart TV and ""DirectvReady"" (operates as a Direct TV ""mini"") is a drawback. There simply are not enough named button choices for it to be intuitive to use easily. I can only recommend it for the ability to turn on the right devices for a particular function, such as listen to the radio or watch a DVD. It's too expensive when you can't do it all with ease.",jtaa,2

My daughters boyfriend said it perfectly. ""At first I hated this remote. Now I love it."" The programming might be a little too challenging for some, I understand. If you're giving it a shot, good for you! Just have your make and model #'s ready. Also the input source . Example; Samsung Blue Ray, Model ????, connects thru HDMI #2. If all else fails, spend the $ and have the geek squad install it. I say this ONLY because it has a ""help"" button. You WON'T need the geek squad to come back and fix it for you. You point the remote AT the TV and push the ""help"" button. The remote will check everything connected to your T.V.. One step at a time. Just keep pointing the remote AT the T.V. The remote will also ask questions which you answer by pushing the ""yes' or ""no"" button. The only thing easier is to just yell at the top of your lungs ""Robin, it's not working"".

The sync would hang without finishing, or wouldn't start up at all, and the setup failed to recognize a couple of my devices even though I was absolutely certain I had entered the correct model numbers.

Pretty awesome, the screen looks very nice and the backlit keys are nice. Fits nicely in hand. One thing to think about is looking down at the screen, most remotes can be operated by feel without looking, the nice display requires a glance down to see what to press. However you can still use the physical buttons as well for most functions if you don't always want to use the screen.

I don't understand why Logitech decided to change the layout and place the DVR controls on the top. Good luck using those controls without hitting the screen, unless you got huge banana hands.

It has literally replaced all remotes for a 65"" Panasonic TV, Fios cable box, Marantz receiver doing audio/video switching, Xbox 360, BluRay Player, a PC and a few other components. It does so as flawlessly as can be expected and has very solid range and breadth of of beam so never misses (I've even pointed it backwards a foot from cushions).Once it's set up it has my 65 year old mother/father able to use it as well as my 5 year old daughter and 10 year old son. Once programming is done it has vastly simplified things they want to do. Nice customization allows you to use custom icons for various devices and channels. Ability to have two different commands for the same button (press = skip forward and press+hold = fast forward). You can also take some or all commands and put them in the touch screen menu for infrequent use. If you are willing to invest a bit of time in this, it's a great and permanent solution.One thing to realize, while they have a very nice and intuitive computer based setup, the capabilities of this device make for some time spent programming to set it up. If one isn't tech savvy and/or doesn't have more than 2 main devices, this device may be overkill and using the cable box remote and occasionally grabbing the DVD remote might be the better solution. More succinctly - a $10 inconvenience may not warrant a $250 solution/remote.",HomeTheater,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Good Solid Remote,"Ultimate One, a very good remote, pricey, but does everything you'd want in a remote and then some. Very easy to set up if you have all your product info. This remote does not include the hub, nor can you control Wii. It will let you input the Wii and turn on/off appropriate equipment but that's it. This one has a sleep timer which my old Harmony One didn't have. It's a nice feature. It's smaller than the Harmony One but feels good in hand. One issue is that without a number pad it's hard to use the remote without looking at it. It has a virtual keypad. The tactile keys are excellent and you can really feel when you press a key. All in all, it's very good, worked flawlessly the first time after set up. I may have wanted the hub so I could control everything from my IPAD, but it wasn't a deal breaker and you can always buy the hub separately. The set up program gives you an upgrade option if you buy the hub separately.",Clubowner,4

My cable box is situated in a spot where the OEM ATT remote would frequently miss a command, however the Harmony One has only missed once in 2 months.

And it actually fixed the problem.Highly recommend.",PoMan,5
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Does what it says it does...,"We were forced to add a cable box as Charter cable switched service to all digital cable in our area.Charter Cable supplied a universal remote with the cable box but it left a lot to be desired when it came to switching between the TV, cable box, and Blu-ray player. My wife was having a difficuilt time juggling 3 remotes to select the right TV input and switch between the Blu-ray player and cable box.So, a quick trip to my local Best Buy and I picked up the Logitech - Harmony Ultimate One universal remote. Took it home, opened the box and conected it to our PC after downloading the Logitech software. A few quick klicks to enter our equippment for remote control and mabye 10 minutes to load 50 favorite channels and Voilà!We now have a one button push solution to ""Watch TV"" and a one button push to ""Watch a Move"". The Logitech remote also has a ""Sleep Timer Function"" to shut everything down - great feature as we use this TV in the bedroom.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Overall a pretty decent remote,"I bought this remote to replace my Harmony One. When designing this remote, it is clear that Logitech was trying to put as few buttons as possible. They put most of the functionality on the scrolling touch screen and made some of the buttons dual purpose (The channel down/up buttons are also the page up/down buttons). This can be annoying at times. I have only had this remote for a few weeks but it is pretty good. I think it will get better when Logitech releases software updates. Maybe this will increase the battery life. I am rating it three stars because of the short battery life. It seems like I have to put it on the charger every other day. My Harmony One would go a week or two between charging (with the same amount of use). I suspect that the shortened battery life is a result of more reliance on the touch screen.",TVWatcher,3

That's it! Unplug it from your computer and you're ready to go. It has a digital screen that behaves much like a smart phone.You choose "" Whatch TV"" , ""Whatch DVD"" etc. You can also have custom settings like; "" ""Play Pandora"" click your choice and it does all the work.If something doesn't come on right.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Lots Of Features, Not All Work Smoothly","It is a replacement for the excellent Harmony One, who's 5 button gave up. While the new unit is well built, and they have reduced the number of buttons, the touch screen does not make it easier to operate. The multiple screens scroll too easily and it is easier to push an unintended command. The execution of a command occurs slower on my devices as well.The unit feels good to hold, is well built and is mostly well balanced. The touchscreen retains fingerprints.The unit was fairly easy to convert the commands from my old Harmony to the new one, and Harmony's on line setup is easy to use and has a large database of products.My biggest problem is the 30 second fast forward command for recorded material or after rewinding a current program. It is now combined with the regular fast forward button and simply is much harder to use. Too often, because it is at the top, balance is an issue and you end up simply fast forwarding because it is difficult to push the button hard enough and maintain balance to pull off the command you want.Overall, however, I am satisfied with the purchase and find it worth the price paid.",MarcE,4

You know how you can eventually learn where the buttons on a remote are, and you don't have to look at it? You just kind of feel for the buttons?

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Poor control placement, gimicky touchscreen","The most comfortable way to hold this controller is on the bottom, placing your thumb around the directional pad and bottom buttons. It's awkward to reach both the touchscreen and the main player buttons at the top of the remote, so playing / fast-forwarding shows you have recorded (for instance) feels strange. I have large hands, but my wife experienced the same problems.On the plus side, the revised Harmony software is much better. I've owned the top-line Harmony remotes for years, and all of my set-ups were easily and conveniently imported from the old software. Being a previous Harmony owner might impact my review, since I'm so used to how the older remotes were laid out and felt in the hand.I ended up returning this remote for the Harmony 700, which has much more natural button positions and ""clickier"" buttons in general, making for a very satisfying hand-feel when in use. Another bonus for the 700 is that the overall physical build and limited screen size makes it feel much sturdier--I've lost two remotes to small kids who've managed to drop remotes and shatter the screens. Teh 700 also benefits from the updated software.I would only recommend the Ultimate One to people who need to control more than 8 devices.",RovingMule,1

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Darn good remotin',"Since I don't have cable and use an XBox 360, plus a sound bar, watching TV used to be a three-remote affair, with all three having to be out if I wanted to change shows, change the volume, or power off any given device. I looked up universal remotes, and although a bit pricey, the Harmony One supported all my devices, and allowed me to program functionality on all of my devices into a single activity that I call ""Watch TV."" Now when I hit the ""Watch TV"" icon on the little LED screen, the TV, sound bar, and XBox all turn on at the same time, on the settings I would need to watch my shows. Furthermore, I don't need to switch to ""modes"" when using different devices, each button can be programmed to activate a device's function independent of the other devices in the chain.

So I got this unit because it has more options, more favorite channels, etc. It works, but I'm using the HELP button a lot because it doesn't turn something off or on. I agree with another reviewer that the control buttons at the top are a design problem because it is too easy to inadvertently touch the touch screen underneath and change something.

This remote does have a second IR blaster, but it's on the bottom for when you're using the touch screen. Other than that, great remote that really lives up to the Harmony name.

Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,good replacement to the harmony 880,"I had a harmony 880 for almost 6 years till it broke last month. Then i purchased the ""Harmony home control"". That device was totally useless in its programming and user friendliness. all you could do was turn some devices on and off and adjust volume, thats it. Everything else you and to do through the app ( which is a bigger disaster).Then I purchased this device- the Logitech Harmony ultimate one. It was easy to program, and wait you can control individual devices from the remote itself. Say you are listening to some music and want to change the sound settings on your receiver, all you have to do is navigate on the onscreen remote and change dolby surround to say ""hall in vienna"" or something. The same activity on the ""logitech harmony home"" is not possible and you will have to use the phone app to make the change.I also like the favorite channels listed on-screen and can easily toggle between channels. I really don't care that the number screen is the second or third swipe screen on the device since i rarely use it and the 50 listed favorites channels can pretty much get me what i watch.Also there is a gripe that the fwd and rewind buttons are on the top of the device. That has not bothered me much at all. it takes some time getting used to but not a deal breaker.",scapula,5

This is an issue if the kids were watching tv at a loud volume level. Then, after they are in bed and I try to watch tv, the volume is very loud and I am not able to adjust it down until the remote is ready. 30 seconds of loud TV once the kids are in bed is like 10 minutes, underwater!The battery life is only 3 days or so, compared to my last harmony remote that lasted 10-14 days.I'm thinking about going back to my old 700 series Harmony,",skyboxfan,3

Took it home, opened the box and conected it to our PC after downloading the Logitech software. A few quick klicks to enter our equippment for remote control and mabye 10 minutes to load 50 favorite channels and Voil!We now have a one button push solution to ""Watch TV"" and a one button push to ""Watch a Move"". The Logitech remote also has a ""Sleep Timer Function"" to shut everything down - great feature as we use this TV in the bedroom. Happy wife = happy life!Thinking about buying a second one it they come down in price...",Petey,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,"Nice, modern design","The remote feels good my hand. Good thing that it can be programmed for a bunch of station presets, because to get to the manual number input screen is about 3 screens deep. The lack of a permanent number pad contributes to a very contemporary appearance. But, if you find that you forgot to program one of your favs, you may end up like me, searching for the component remote to access my channel number and put off programming the Ultimate until a later time. Fortunately, when I do get time to do the programming, it is super easy with the Harmony on-line tool.",rossberg01,4
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Poor design,"The bad: It's a two handed remote. By that I mean that you have to hold it in your hand to use it. You can't just leave it on the end table or other surface and reach over and push a button on it because the bottom is rounded. Another design flub is that the transport keys are located above the touch screen ! If you want to push play, rewind, pause etc., and you brush your hand across the touch screen before it times out you'll change the channel, or something else. Very irritating!! The good: It's very easy to program, and the charging cradle it a winner !",lauve2005,3
Logitech,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,Great Remote,"This remote was a decent replacement for my logitech 1100 that died after so many years of use. It has a decent shape and is easy to program. takes a bout 4-5 times to get used to the menu functions but that is pretty much with any new remote. Charge holds pretty good, for solid daily use can be about 5-7 days and it will start to drian. but it charges super quick, so if its dying out put on a movie and set it on charger and it should be pretty much full by end of the show. Would recommend, and I am also thinking of getting one for my bedroom also. much better than my cable remote. Regards",daddyluv01,4
